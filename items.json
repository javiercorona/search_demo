If you are looking for the current season's FTC SDK software, please visit the new and permanent home of the public FTC SDK:  FtcRobotController repository  Welcome! This GitHub repository contains the source code that is used to build an Android app to control a FIRST Tech Challenge competition robot. To use this SDK, download/clone the entire project to your local computer.  Getting Started If you are new to robotics or new to the FIRST Tech Challenge, then you should consider reviewing the FTC Blocks Tutorial to get familiar with how to use the control system:        FTC Blocks Online Tutorial  Even if you are an advanced Java programmer, it is helpful to start with the FTC Blocks tutorial, and then migrate to the OnBot Java Tool or to Android Studio afterwards.  Downloading the Project If you are an Android Studio programmer, there are several ways to download this repo. Note that if you use the Blocks or OnBot Java Tool to program your robot, then you do not need to download this repository.  If you are a git user, you can clone the most current version of the repository:             git clone https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE.git  Or, if you prefer, you can use the \"Download Zip\" button available through the main repository page. Downloading the project as a .ZIP file will keep the size of the download manageable.  You can also download the project folder (as a .zip or .tar.gz archive file) from the Downloads subsection of the Releases page for this repository.  Once you have downloaded and uncompressed (if needed) your folder, you can use Android Studio to import the folder (\"Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)\").  Getting Help User Documentation and Tutorials FIRST maintains online documentation with information and tutorials on how to use the FIRST Tech Challenge software and robot control system. You can access this documentation using the following link:        SKYSTONE Online Documentation  Note that the online documentation is an \"evergreen\" document that is constantly being updated and edited. It contains the most current information about the FIRST Tech Challenge software and control system.  Javadoc Reference Material The Javadoc reference documentation for the FTC SDK is now available online. Click on the following link to view the FTC SDK Javadoc documentation as a live website:        FTC Javadoc Documentation  Documentation for the FTC SDK is also included with this repository. There is a subfolder called \"doc\" which contains several subfolders:  The folder \"apk\" contains the .apk files for the FTC Driver Station and FTC Robot Controller apps. The folder \"javadoc\" contains the JavaDoc user documentation for the FTC SDK. Online User Forum For technical questions regarding the Control System or the FTC SDK, please visit the FTC Technology forum:        FTC Technology Forum  Release Information Version 5.5 (20200824-090813) Version 5.5 requires Android Studio 4.0 or later.  New features Adds support for calling custom Java classes from Blocks OpModes (fixes SkyStone issue #161). Classes must be in the org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode package. Methods must be public static and have no more than 21 parameters. Parameters declared as OpMode, LinearOpMode, Telemetry, and HardwareMap are supported and the argument is provided automatically, regardless of the order of the parameters. On the block, the sockets for those parameters are automatically filled in. Parameters declared as char or java.lang.Character will accept any block that returns text and will only use the first character in the text. Parameters declared as boolean or java.lang.Boolean will accept any block that returns boolean. Parameters declared as byte, java.lang.Byte, short, java.lang.Short, int, java.lang.Integer, long, or java.lang.Long, will accept any block that returns a number and will round that value to the nearest whole number. Parameters declared as float, java.lang.Float, double, java.lang.Double will accept any block that returns a number. Adds telemetry API method for setting display format Classic Monospace HTML (certain tags only) Adds blocks support for switching cameras. Adds Blocks support for TensorFlow Object Detection with a custom model. Adds support for uploading a custom TensorFlow Object Detection model in the Manage page, which is especially useful for Blocks and OnBotJava users. Shows new Control Hub blink codes when the WiFi band is switched using the Control Hub's button (only possible on Control Hub OS 1.1.2) Adds new warnings which can be disabled in the Advanced RC Settings Mismatched app versions warning Unnecessary 2.4 GHz WiFi usage warning REV Hub is running outdated firmware (older than version 1.8.2) Adds support for Sony PS4 gamepad, and reworks how gamepads work on the Driver Station Removes preference which sets gamepad type based on driver position. Replaced with menu which allows specifying type for gamepads with unknown VID and PID Attempts to auto-detect gamepad type based on USB VID and PID If gamepad VID and PID is not known, use type specified by user for that VID and PID If gamepad VID and PID is not known AND the user has not specified a type for that VID and PID, an educated guess is made about how to map the gamepad Driver Station will now attempt to automatically recover from a gamepad disconnecting, and re-assign it to the position it was assigned to when it dropped If only one gamepad is assigned and it drops: it can be recovered If two gamepads are assigned, and have different VID/PID signatures, and only one drops: it will be recovered If two gamepads are assigned, and have different VID/PID signatures, and BOTH drop: both will be recovered If two gamepads are assigned, and have the same VID/PID signatures, and only one drops: it will be recovered If two gamepads are assigned, and have the same VID/PID signatures, and BOTH drop: neither will be recovered, because of the ambiguity of the gamepads when they re-appear on the USB bus. There is currently one known edge case: if there are two gamepads with the same VID/PID signature plugged in, but only one is assigned, and they BOTH drop, it's a 50-50 chance of which one will be chosen for automatic recovery to the assigned position: it is determined by whichever one is re-enumerated first by the USB bus controller. Adds landscape user interface to Driver Station New feature: practice timer with audio cues New feature (Control Hub only): wireless network connection strength indicator (0-5 bars) New feature (Control Hub only): tapping on the ping/channel display will switch to an alternate display showing radio RX dBm and link speed (tap again to switch back) The layout will NOT autorotate. You can switch the layout from the Driver Station's settings menu. Breaking changes Removes support for Android versions 4.4 through 5.1 (KitKat and Lollipop). The minSdkVersion is now 23. Removes the deprecated LinearOpMode methods waitOneFullHardwareCycle() and waitForNextHardwareCycle() Enhancements Handles RS485 address of Control Hub automatically The Control Hub is automatically given a reserved address Existing configuration files will continue to work All addresses in the range of 1-10 are still available for Expansion Hubs The Control Hub light will now normally be solid green, without blinking to indicate the address The Control Hub will not be shown on the Expansion Hub Address Change settings page Improves REV Hub firmware updater The user can now choose between all available firmware update files Version 1.8.2 of the REV Hub firmware is bundled into the Robot Controller app. Text was added to clarify that Expansion Hubs can only be updated via USB. Firmware update speed was reduced to improve reliability Allows REV Hub firmware to be updated directly from the Manage webpage Improves log viewer on Robot Controller Horizontal scrolling support (no longer word wrapped) Supports pinch-to-zoom Uses a monospaced font Error messages are highlighted New color scheme Attempts to force-stop a runaway/stuck OpMode without restarting the entire app Not all types of runaway conditions are stoppable, but if the user code attempts to talk to hardware during the runaway, the system should be able to capture it. Makes various tweaks to the Self Inspect screen Renames \"OS version\" entry to \"Android version\" Renames \"WiFi Direct Name\" to \"WiFi Name\" Adds Control Hub OS version, when viewing the report of a Control Hub Hides the airplane mode entry, when viewing the report of a Control Hub Removes check for ZTE Speed Channel Changer Shows firmware version for all Expansion and Control Hubs Reworks network settings portion of Manage page All network settings are now applied with a single click The WiFi Direct channel of phone-based Robot Controllers can now be changed from the Manage page WiFi channels are filtered by band (2.4 vs 5 GHz) and whether they overlap with other channels The current WiFi channel is pre-selected on phone-based Robot Controllers, and Control Hubs running OS 1.1.2 or later. On Control Hubs running OS 1.1.2 or later, you can choose to have the system automatically select a channel on the 5 GHz band Improves OnBotJava New light and dark themes replace the old themes (chaos, github, chrome,...) the new default theme is light and will be used when you first update to this version OnBotJava now has a tabbed editor Read-only offline mode Improves function of \"exit\" menu item on Robot Controller and Driver Station Now guaranteed to be fully stopped and unloaded from memory Shows a warning message if a LinearOpMode exists prematurely due to failure to monitor for the start condition Improves error message shown when the Driver Station and Robot Controller are incompatible with each other Driver Station OpMode Control Panel now disabled while a Restart Robot is in progress Disables advanced settings related to WiFi direct when the Robot Controller is a Control Hub. Tint phone battery icons on Driver Station when low/critical. Uses names \"Control Hub Portal\" and \"Control Hub\" (when appropriate) in new configuration files Improve I2C read performance Very large improvement on Control Hub; up to ~2x faster with small (e.g. 6 byte) reads Not as apparent on Expansion Hubs connected to a phone Update/refresh build infrastructure Update to 'androidx' support library from 'com.android.support:appcompat', which is end-of-life Update targetSdkVersion and compileSdkVersion to 28 Update Android Studio's Android plugin to latest Fix reported build timestamp in 'About' screen Add sample illustrating manual webcam use: ConceptWebcam Bug fixes Fixes SkyStone issue #248 Fixes SkyStone issue #232 and modifies bulk caching semantics to allow for cache-preserving MANUAL/AUTO transitions. Improves performance when REV 2M distance sensor is unplugged Improves readability of Toast messages on certain devices Allows a Driver Station to connect to a Robot Controller after another has disconnected Improves generation of fake serial numbers for UVC cameras which do not provide a real serial number Previously some devices would assign such cameras a serial of 0:0 and fail to open and start streaming Fixes ftc_app issue #638. Fixes a slew of bugs with the Vuforia camera monitor including: Fixes bug where preview could be displayed with a wonky aspect ratio Fixes bug where preview could be cut off in landscape Fixes bug where preview got totally messed up when rotating phone Fixes bug where crosshair could drift off target when using webcams Fixes issue in UVC driver on some devices (ftc_app 681) if streaming was started/stopped multiple times in a row Issue manifested as kernel panic on devices which do not have this kernel patch. On affected devices which do have the patch, the issue was manifest as simply a failure to start streaming. The Tech Team believes that the root cause of the issue is a bug in the Linux kernel XHCI driver. A workaround was implemented in the SDK UVC driver. Fixes bug in UVC driver where often half the frames from the camera would be dropped (e.g. only 15FPS delivered during a streaming session configured for 30FPS). Fixes issue where TensorFlow Object Detection would show results whose confidence was lower than the minimum confidence parameter. Fixes a potential exploitation issue of CVE-2019-11358 in OnBotJava Fixes changing the address of an Expansion Hub with additional Expansion Hubs connected to it Preserves the Control Hub's network connection when \"Restart Robot\" is selected Fixes issue where device scans would fail while the Robot was restarting Fix RenderScript usage Use androidx.renderscript variant: increased compatibility Use RenderScript in Java mode, not native: simplifies build Fixes webcam-frame-to-bitmap conversion problem: alpha channel wasn't being initialized, only R, G, & B Fixes possible arithmetic overflow in Deadline Fixes deadlock in Vuforia webcam support which could cause 5-second delays when stopping OpMode Version 5.4 (20200108-101156) Fixes SkyStone issue #88 Adds an inspection item that notes when a robot controller (Control Hub) is using the factory default password. Fixes SkyStone issue #61 Fixes SkyStone issue #142 Fixes ftc_app issue #417 by adding more current and voltage monitoring capabilities for REV Hubs. Fixes a crash sometimes caused by OnBotJava activity Improves OnBotJava autosave functionality ftc_app #738 Fixes system responsiveness issue when an Expansion Hub is disconnected Fixes issue where IMU initialization could prevent Op Modes from stopping Fixes issue where AndroidTextToSpeech.speak() would fail if it was called too early Adds telemetry.speak() methods and blocks, which cause the Driver Station (if also updated) to speak text Adds and improves Expansion Hub-related warnings Improves Expansion Hub low battery warning Displays the warning immediately after the hub reports it Specifies whether the condition is current or occurred temporarily during an OpMode run Displays which hubs reported low battery Displays warning when hub loses and regains power during an OpMode run Fixes the hub's LED pattern after this condition Displays warning when Expansion Hub is not responding to commands Specifies whether the condition is current or occurred temporarily during an OpMode run Clarifies warning when Expansion Hub is not present at startup Specifies that this condition requires a Robot Restart before the hub can be used. The hub light will now accurately reflect this state Improves logging and reduces log spam during these conditions Syncs the Control Hub time and timezone to a connected web browser programming the robot, if a Driver Station is not available. Adds bulk read functionality for REV Hubs A bulk caching mode must be set at the Hub level with LynxModule#setBulkCachingMode(). This applies to all relevant SDK hardware classes that reference that Hub. The following following Hub bulk caching modes are available: BulkCachingMode.OFF (default): All hardware calls operate as usual. Bulk data can read through LynxModule#getBulkData() and processed manually. BulkCachingMode.AUTO: Applicable hardware calls are served from a bulk read cache that is cleared/refreshed automatically to ensure identical commands don't hit the same cache. The cache can also be cleared manually with LynxModule#clearBulkCache(), although this is not recommended. (advanced users) BulkCachingMode.MANUAL: Same as BulkCachingMode.AUTO except the cache is never cleared automatically. To avoid getting stale data, the cache must be manually cleared at the beginning of each loop body or as the user deems appropriate. Removes PIDF Annotation values added in Rev 5.3 (to AndyMark, goBILDA and TETRIX motor configurations). The new motor types will still be available but their Default control behavior will revert back to Rev 5.2 Adds new ConceptMotorBulkRead sample Opmode to demonstrate and compare Motor Bulk-Read modes for reducing I/O latencies. Version 5.3 (20191004-112306) Fixes external USB/UVC webcam support Makes various bugfixes and improvements to Blocks page, including but not limited to: Many visual tweaks Browser zoom and window resize behave better Resizing the Java preview pane works better and more consistently across browsers The Java preview pane consistently gets scrollbars when needed The Java preview pane is hidden by default on phones Internet Explorer 11 should work Large dropdown lists display properly on lower res screens Disabled buttons are now visually identifiable as disabled A warning is shown if a user selects a TFOD sample, but their device is not compatible Warning messages in a Blocks op mode are now visible by default. Adds goBILDA 5201 and 5202 motors to Robot Configurator Adds PIDF Annotation values to AndyMark, goBILDA and TETRIX motor configurations. This has the effect of causing the RUN_USING_ENCODERS and RUN_TO_POSITION modes to use PIDF vs PID closed loop control on these motors. This should provide more responsive, yet stable, speed control. PIDF adds Feedforward control to the basic PID control loop. Feedforward is useful when controlling a motor's speed because it \"anticipates\" how much the control voltage must change to achieve a new speed set-point, rather than requiring the integrated error to change sufficiently. The PIDF values were chosen to provide responsive, yet stable, speed control on a lightly loaded motor. The more heavily a motor is loaded (drag or friction), the more noticable the PIDF improvement will be. Fixes startup crash on Android 10 Fixes ftc_app issue #712 (thanks to FROGbots-4634) Fixes ftc_app issue #542 Allows \"A\" and lowercase letters when naming device through RC and DS apps. Version 5.2 (20190905-083277) Fixes extra-wide margins on settings activities, and placement of the new configuration button Adds Skystone Vuforia image target data. Includes sample Skystone Vuforia Navigation op modes (Java). Includes sample Skystone Vuforia Navigation op modes (Blocks). Adds TensorFlow inference model (.tflite) for Skystone game elements. Includes sample Skystone TensorFlow op modes (Java). Includes sample Skystone TensorFlow op modes (Blocks). Removes older (season-specific) sample op modes. Includes 64-bit support (to comply with Google Play requirements). Protects against Stuck OpModes when a Restart Robot is requested. (Thanks to FROGbots-4634) (ftc_app issue #709) Blocks related changes: Fixes bug with blocks generated code when hardware device name is a java or javascript reserved word. Shows generated java code for blocks, even when hardware items are missing from the active configuration. Displays warning icon when outdated Vuforia and TensorFlow blocks are used (SkyStone issue #27) Version 5.1 (20190820-222104) Defines default PIDF parameters for the following motors: REV Core Hex Motor REV 20:1 HD Hex Motor REV 40:1 HD Hex Motor Adds back button when running on a device without a system back button (such as a Control Hub) Allows a REV Control Hub to update the firmware on a REV Expansion Hub via USB Fixes SkyStone issue #9 Fixes ftc_app issue #715 Prevents extra DS User clicks by filtering based on current state. Prevents incorrect DS UI state changes when receiving new OpMode list from RC Adds support for REV Color Sensor V3 Adds a manual-refresh DS Camera Stream for remotely viewing RC camera frames. To show the stream on the DS, initialize but do not run a stream-enabled opmode, select the Camera Stream option in the DS menu, and tap the image to refresh. This feature is automatically enabled when using Vuforia or TFOD—no additional RC configuration is required for typical use cases. To hide the stream, select the same menu item again. Note that gamepads are disabled and the selected opmode cannot be started while the stream is open as a safety precaution. To use custom streams, consult the API docs for CameraStreamServer#setSource and CameraStreamSource. Adds many Star Wars sounds to RobotController resources. Added SKYSTONE Sounds Chooser Sample Program. Switches out startup, connect chimes, and error/warning sounds for Star Wars sounds Updates OnBot Java to use a WebSocket for communication with the robot The OnBot Java page no longer has to do a full refresh when a user switches from editing one file to another Known issues:  Camera Stream The Vuforia camera stream inherits the issues present in the phone preview (namely ftc_app issue #574). This problem does not affect the TFOD camera stream even though it receives frames from Vuforia. The orientation of the stream frames may not always match the phone preview. For now, these frames may be rotated manually via a custom CameraStreamSource if desired. OnBotJava Browser back button may not always work correctly It's possible for a build to be queued, but not started. The OnBot Java build console will display a warning if this occurs. A user might not realize they are editing a different file if the user inadvertently switches from one file to another since this switch is now seamless. The name of the currently open file is displayed in the browser tab. Version 5.0 (built on 19.06.14) Support for the REV Robotics Control Hub. Adds a Java preview pane to the Blocks editor. Adds a new offline export feature to the Blocks editor. Display wifi channel in Network circle on Driver Station. Adds calibration for Logitech C270 Updates build tooling and target SDK. Compliance with Google's permissions infrastructure (Required after build tooling update). Keep Alives to mitigate the Motorola wifi scanning problem. Telemetry substitute no longer necessary. Improves Vuforia error reporting. Fixes ftctechnh/ftc_app issues 621, 713. Miscellaneous bug fixes and improvements. Version 4.3 (built on 18.10.31) Includes missing TensorFlow-related libraries and files. Version 4.2 (built on 18.10.30) Includes fix to avoid deadlock situation with WatchdogMonitor which could result in USB communication errors. Comm error appeared to require that user disconnect USB cable and restart the Robot Controller app to recover. robotControllerLog.txt would have error messages that included the words \"E RobotCore: lynx xmit lock: #### abandoning lock:\" Includes fix to correctly list the parent module address for a REV Robotics Expansion Hub in a configuration (.xml) file. Bug in versions 4.0 and 4.1 would incorrect list the address module for a parent REV Robotics device as \"1\". If the parent module had a higher address value than the daisy-chained module, then this bug would prevent the Robot Controller from communicating with the downstream Expansion Hub. Added requirement for ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION to allow a Driver Station running Android Oreo to scan for Wi-Fi Direct devices. Added google() repo to build.gradle because aapt2 must be downloaded from the google() repository beginning with version 3.2 of the Android Gradle Plugin. Important Note: Android Studio users will need to be connected to the Internet the first time build the ftc_app project. Internet connectivity is required for the first build so the appropriate files can be downloaded from the Google repository. Users should not need to be connected to the Internet for subsequent builds. This should also fix buid issue where Android Studio would complain that it \"Could not find com.android.tools.lint:lint-gradle:26.1.4\" (or similar). Added support for REV Spark Mini motor controller as part of the configuration menu for a servo/PWM port on the REV Expansion Hub. Provide examples for playing audio files in an Op Mode. Block Development Tool Changes Includes a fix for a problem with the Velocity blocks that were reported in the FTC Technology forum (Blocks Programming subforum). Change the \"Save completed successfully.\" message to a white color so it will contrast with a green background. Fixed the \"Download image\" feature so it will work if there are text blocks in the op mode. Introduce support for Google's TensorFlow Lite technology for object detetion for 2018-2019 game. TensorFlow lite can recognize Gold Mineral and Silver Mineral from 2018-2019 game. Example Java and Block op modes are included to show how to determine the relative position of the gold block (left, center, right). Version 4.1 (released on 18.09.24) Changes include:  Fix to prevent crash when deprecated configuration annotations are used. Change to allow FTC Robot Controller APK to be auto-updated using FIRST Global Control Hub update scripts. Removed samples for non supported / non legal hardware. Improvements to Telemetry.addData block with \"text\" socket. Updated Blocks sample op mode list to include Rover Ruckus Vuforia example. Update SDK library version number. Version 4.0 (released on 18.09.12) Changes include:  Initial support for UVC compatible cameras  If UVC camera has a unique serial number, RC will detect and enumerate by serial number. If UVC camera lacks a unique serial number, RC will only support one camera of that type connected. Calibration settings for a few cameras are included (see TeamCode/src/main/res/xml/teamwebcamcalibrations.xml for details). User can upload calibration files from Program and Manage web interface. UVC cameras seem to draw a fair amount of electrical current from the USB bus. This does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub. This does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller. FTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers. Updated sample Vuforia Navigation and VuMark Op Modes to demonstrate how to use an internal phone-based camera and an external UVC webcam. Support for improved motor control.  REV Robotics Expansion Hub firmware 1.8 and greater will support a feed forward mechanism for closed loop motor control. FTC SDK has been modified to support PIDF coefficients (proportional, integral, derivative, and feed forward). FTC Blocks development tool modified to include PIDF programming blocks. Deprecated older PID-related methods and variables. REV's 1.8.x PIDF-related changes provide a more linear and accurate way to control a motor. Wireless  Added 5GHz support for wireless channel changing for those devices that support it. Tested with Moto G5 and E4 phones. Also tested with other (currently non-approved) phones such as Samsung Galaxy S8. Improved Expansion Hub firmware update support in Robot Controller app  Changes to make the system more robust during the firmware update process (when performed through Robot Controller app). User no longer has to disconnect a downstream daisy-chained Expansion Hub when updating an Expansion Hub's firmware. If user is updating an Expansion Hub's firmware through a USB connection, he/she does not have to disconnect RS485 connection to other Expansion Hubs. The user still must use a USB connection to update an Expansion Hub's firmware. The user cannot update the Expansion Hub firmware for a downstream device that is daisy chained through an RS485 connection. If an Expansion Hub accidentally gets \"bricked\" the Robot Controller app is now more likely to recognize the Hub when it scans the USB bus. Robot Controller app should be able to detect an Expansion Hub, even if it accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt. Robot Controller app should be able to install the firmware onto the Hub, even if if accidentally was bricked in a previous update attempt. Resiliency  FTC software can detect and enable an FTDI reset feature that is available with REV Robotics v1.8 Expansion Hub firmware and greater. When enabled, the Expansion Hub can detect if it hasn't communicated with the Robot Controller over the FTDI (USB) connection. If the Hub hasn't heard from the Robot Controller in a while, it will reset the FTDI connection. This action helps system recover from some ESD-induced disruptions. Various fixes to improve reliability of FTC software. Blocks  Fixed errors with string and list indices in blocks export to java. Support for USB connected UVC webcams. Refactored optimized Blocks Vuforia code to support Rover Ruckus image targets. Added programming blocks to support PIDF (proportional, integral, derivative and feed forward) motor control. Added formatting options (under Telemetry and Miscellaneous categories) so user can set how many decimal places to display a numerical value. Support to play audio files (which are uploaded through Blocks web interface) on Driver Station in addition to the Robot Controller. Fixed bug with Download Image of Blocks feature. Support for REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller. Support for REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor. Added support for a REV Touch Sensor (no longer have to configure as a generic digital device). Added blocks for DcMotorEx methods. These are enhanced methods that you can use when supported by the motor controller hardware. The REV Robotics Expansion Hub supports these enhanced methods. Enhanced methods include methods to get/set motor velocity (in encoder pulses per second), get/set PIDF coefficients, etc.. Modest Improvements in Logging  Decrease frequency of battery checker voltage statements. Removed non-FTC related log statements (wherever possible). Introduced a \"Match Logging\" feature. Under \"Settings\" a user can enable/disable this feature (it's disabled by default). If enabled, user provides a \"Match Number\" through the Driver Station user interface (top of the screen). The Match Number is used to create a log file specifically with log statements from that particular Op Mode run. Match log files are stored in /sdcard/FIRST/matlogs on the Robot Controller. Once an op mode run is complete, the Match Number is cleared. This is a convenient way to create a separate match log with statements only related to a specific op mode run. New Devices  Support for REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller. Support for REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor. Added configuration option for REV 20:1 HD Hex Motor. Added support for a REV Touch Sensor (no longer have to configure as a generic digital device). Miscellaneous  Fixed some errors in the definitions for acceleration and velocity in our javadoc documentation. Added ability to play audio files on Driver Station When user is configuring an Expansion Hub, the LED on the Expansion Hub will change blink pattern (purple-cyan) to indicate which Hub is currently being configured. Renamed I2cSensorType to I2cDeviceType. Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates localization using 2018-2019 (Rover Ruckus presented by QualComm) Vuforia targets. Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics 2m Laser Distance Sensor. Added an external sample Op Mode that demonstrates how to use the REV Robotics Blinkin LED Controller. Re-categorized external Java sample Op Modes to \"TeleOp\" instead of \"Autonomous\". Known issues:  Initial support for UVC compatible cameras  UVC cameras seem to draw significant amount of current from the USB bus. This does not appear to present any problems for the REV Robotics Control Hub. This does seem to create stability problems when using some cameras with an Android phone-based Robot Controller. FTC Tech Team is investigating options to mitigate this issue with the phone-based Robot Controllers. There might be a possible deadlock which causes the RC to become unresponsive when using a UVC webcam with a Nougat Android Robot Controller. Wireless  When user selects a wireless channel, this channel does not necessarily persist if the phone is power cycled. Tech Team is hoping to eventually address this issue in a future release. Issue has been present since apps were introduced (i.e., it is not new with the v4.0 release). Wireless channel is not currently displayed for WiFi Direct connections. Miscellaneous  The blink indication feature that shows which Expansion Hub is currently being configured does not work for a newly created configuration file. User has to first save a newly created configuration file and then close and re-edit the file in order for blink indicator to work. Version 3.6 (built on 17.12.18) Changes include:  Blocks Changes Uses updated Google Blockly software to allow users to edit their op modes on Apple iOS devices (including iPad and iPhone). Improvement in Blocks tool to handle corrupt op mode files. Autonomous op modes should no longer get switched back to tele-op after re-opening them to be edited. The system can now detect type mismatches during runtime and alert the user with a message on the Driver Station. Updated javadoc documentation for setPower() method to reflect correct range of values (-1 to +1). Modified VuforiaLocalizerImpl to allow for user rendering of frames Added a user-overrideable onRenderFrame() method which gets called by the class's renderFrame() method. Version 3.5 (built on 17.10.30) Changes with version 3.5 include:  Introduced a fix to prevent random op mode stops, which can occur after the Robot Controller app has been paused and then resumed (for example, when a user temporarily turns off the display of the Robot Controller phone, and then turns the screen back on). Introduced a fix to prevent random op mode stops, which were previously caused by random peer disconnect events on the Driver Station. Fixes issue where log files would be closed on pause of the RC or DS, but not re-opened upon resume. Fixes issue with battery handler (voltage) start/stop race. Fixes issue where Android Studio generated op modes would disappear from available list in certain situations. Fixes problem where OnBot Java would not build on REV Robotics Control Hub. Fixes problem where OnBot Java would not build if the date and time on the Robot Controller device was \"rewound\" (set to an earlier date/time). Improved error message on OnBot Java that occurs when renaming a file fails. Removed unneeded resources from android.jar binaries used by OnBot Java to reduce final size of Robot Controller app. Added MR_ANALOG_TOUCH_SENSOR block to Blocks Programming Tool. Version 3.4 (built on 17.09.06) Changes with version 3.4 include:  Added telemetry.update() statement for BlankLinearOpMode template. Renamed sample Block op modes to be more consistent with Java samples. Added some additional sample Block op modes. Reworded OnBot Java readme slightly. Version 3.3 (built on 17.09.04) This version of the software includes improves for the FTC Blocks Programming Tool and the OnBot Java Programming Tool.  Changes with verion 3.3 include:  Android Studio ftc_app project has been updated to use Gradle Plugin 2.3.3. Android Studio ftc_app project is already using gradle 3.5 distribution. Robot Controller log has been renamed to /sdcard/RobotControllerLog.txt (note that this change was actually introduced w/ v3.2). Improvements in I2C reliability. Optimized I2C read for REV Expansion Hub, with v1.7 firmware or greater. Updated all external/samples (available through OnBot and in Android project folder). Vuforia Added support for VuMarks that will be used for the 2017-2018 season game. Blocks Update to latest Google Blockly release. Sample op modes can be selected as a template when creating new op mode. Fixed bug where the blocks would disappear temporarily when mouse button is held down. Added blocks for Range.clip and Range.scale. User can now disable/enable Block op modes. Fix to prevent occasional Blocks deadlock. OnBot Java Significant improvements with autocomplete function for OnBot Java editor. Sample op modes can be selected as a template when creating new op mode. Fixes and changes to complete hardware setup feature. Updated (and more useful) onBot welcome message. Known issues:  Android Studio After updating to the new v3.3 Android Studio project folder, if you get error messages indicating \"InvalidVirtualFileAccessException\" then you might need to do a File->Invalidate Caches / Restart to clear the error. OnBot Java Sometimes when you push the build button to build all op modes, the RC returns an error message that the build failed. If you press the build button a second time, the build typically suceeds. Version 3.2 (built on 17.08.02) This version of the software introduces the \"OnBot Java\" Development Tool. Similar to the FTC Blocks Development Tool, the FTC OnBot Java Development Tool allows a user to create, edit and build op modes dynamically using only a Javascript-enabled web browser.  The OnBot Java Development Tool is an integrated development environment (IDE) that is served up by the Robot Controller. Op modes are created and edited using a Javascript-enabled browser (Google Chromse is recommended). Op modes are saved on the Robot Controller Android device directly.  The OnBot Java Development Tool provides a Java programming environment that does NOT need Android Studio.  Changes with version 3.2 include:  Enhanced web-based development tools  Introduction of OnBot Java Development Tool. Web-based programming and management features are \"always on\" (user no longer needs to put Robot Controller into programming mode). Web-based management interface (where user can change Robot Controller name and also easily download Robot Controller log file). OnBot Java, Blocks and Management features available from web based interface. Blocks Programming Development Tool:  Changed \"LynxI2cColorRangeSensor\" block to \"REV Color/range sensor\" block. Fixed tooltip for ColorSensor.isLightOn block. Added blocks for ColorSensor.getNormalizedColors and LynxI2cColorRangeSensor.getNormalizedColors. Added example op modes for digital touch sensor and REV Robotics Color Distance sensor.  User selectable color themes.  Includes many minor enhancements and fixes (too numerous to list).  Known issues:  Auto complete function is incomplete and does not support the following (for now): Access via this keyword Access via super keyword Members of the super cloass, not overridden by the class Any methods provided in the current class Inner classes Can't handle casted objects Any objects coming from an parenthetically enclosed expression Version 3.10 (built on 17.05.09) This version of the software provides support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub. This version also includes improvements in the USB communication layer in an effort to enhance system resiliency. If you were using a 2.x version of the software previously, updating to version 3.1 requires that you also update your Driver Station software in addition to updating the Robot Controller software.  Also note that in version 3.10 software, the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods are no longer available (not deprecated, they have been removed from the SDK). Also note that the the new 3.x software incorporates motor profiles that a user can select as he/she configures the robot.  Changes include:  Blocks changes Added VuforiaTrackableDefaultListener.getPose and Vuforia.trackPose blocks. Added optimized blocks support for Vuforia extended tracking. Added atan2 block to the math category. Added useCompetitionFieldTargetLocations parameter to Vuforia.initialize block. If set to false, the target locations are placed at (0,0,0) with target orientation as specified in https://github.com/gearsincorg/FTCVuforiaDemo/blob/master/Robot_Navigation.java tutorial op mode. Incorporates additional improvements to USB comm layer to improve system resiliency (to recover from a greater number of communication disruptions). Additional Notes Regarding Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.13)  In addition to the release changes listed below (see section labeled \"Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.013)\"), version 3.00 has the following important changes:  Version 3.00 software uses a new version of the FTC Robocol (robot protocol). If you upgrade to v3.0 on the Robot Controller and/or Android Studio side, you must also upgrade the Driver Station software to match the new Robocol. Version 3.00 software removes the setMaxSpeed and getMaxSpeed methods from the DcMotor class. If you have an op mode that formerly used these methods, you will need to remove the references/calls to these methods. Instead, v3.0 provides the max speed information through the use of motor profiles that are selected by the user during robot configuration. Version 3.00 software currently does not have a mechanism to disable extra i2c sensors. We hope to re-introduce this function with a release in the near future. Version 3.00 (built on 17.04.13) *** Use this version of the software at YOUR OWN RISK!!! ***  This software is being released as an \"alpha\" version. Use this version at your own risk!  This pre-release software contains SIGNIFICANT changes, including changes to the Wi-Fi Direct pairing mechanism, rewrites of the I2C sensor classes, changes to the USB/FTDI layer, and the introduction of support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub and the REV Robotics color-range-light sensor. These changes were implemented to improve the reliability and resiliency of the FTC control system.  Please note, however, that version 3.00 is considered \"alpha\" code. This code is being released so that the FIRST community will have an opportunity to test the new REV Expansion Hub electronics module when it becomes available in May. The developers do not recommend using this code for critical applications (i.e., competition use).  *** Use this version of the software at YOUR OWN RISK!!! ***  Changes include:  Major rework of sensor-related infrastructure. Includes rewriting sensor classes to implement synchronous I2C communication. Fix to reset Autonomous timer back to 30 seconds. Implementation of specific motor profiles for approved 12V motors (includes Tetrix, AndyMark, Matrix and REV models). Modest improvements to enhance Wi-Fi P2P pairing.

Fixes bug with projects page for Firefox browser. Added IsSpeaking block to AndroidTextToSpeech. Implements support for the REV Robotics Expansion Hub Implements support for integral REV IMU (physically installed on I2C bus 0, uses same Bosch BNO055 9 axis absolute orientation sensor as Adafruit 9DOF abs orientation sensor). - Implements support for REV color/range/light sensor. Provides support to update Expansion Hub firmware through FTC SDK. Detects REV firmware version and records in log file. Includes support for REV Control Hub (note that the REV Control Hub is not yet approved for FTC use). Implements FTC Blocks programming support for REV Expansion Hub and sensor hardware. Detects and alerts when I2C device disconnect. Version 2.62 (built on 17.01.07) Added null pointer check before calling modeToByte() in finishModeSwitchIfNecessary method for ModernRoboticsUsbDcMotorController class. Changes to enhance Modern Robotics USB protocol robustness. Version 2.61 (released on 16.12.19) Blocks Programming mode changes: Fix to correct issue when an exception was thrown because an OpticalDistanceSensor object appears twice in the hardware map (the second time as a LightSensor). Version 2.6 (released on 16.12.16) Fixes for Gyro class: Improve (decrease) sensor refresh latency. fix isCalibrating issues. Blocks Programming mode changes: Blocks now ignores a device in the configuration xml if the name is empty. Other devices work in configuration work fine. Version 2.5 (internal release on released on 16.12.13) Blocks Programming mode changes: Added blocks support for AdafruitBNO055IMU. Added Download Op Mode button to FtcBocks.html. Added support for copying blocks in one OpMode and pasting them in an other OpMode. The clipboard content is stored on the phone, so the programming mode server must be running. Modified Utilities section of the toolbox. In Programming Mode, display information about the active connections. Fixed paste location when workspace has been scrolled. Added blocks support for the android Accelerometer. Fixed issue where Blocks Upload Op Mode truncated name at first dot. Added blocks support for Android SoundPool. Added type safety to blocks for Acceleration. Added type safety to blocks for AdafruitBNO055IMU.Parameters. Added type safety to blocks for AnalogInput.

Provides ability to disable audio cues. various bug fixes and improvements. Version 2.00 (released on 16.08.19) This is the new release for the upcoming 2016-2017 FIRST Tech Challenge Season. Channel change is enabled in the FTC Robot Controller app for Moto G 2nd and 3rd Gen phones. Users can now use annotations to register/disable their Op Modes. Changes in the Android SDK, JDK and build tool requirements (minsdk=19, java 1.7, build tools 23.0.3). Standardized units in analog input. Cleaned up code for existing analog sensor classes. setChannelMode and getChannelMode were REMOVED from the DcMotorController class. This is important - we no longer set the motor modes through the motor controller. setMode and getMode were added to the DcMotor class. ContinuousRotationServo class has been added to the FTC SDK. Range.clip() method has been overloaded so it can support this operation for int, short and byte integers. Some changes have been made (new methods added) on how a user can access items from the hardware map. Users can now set the zero power behavior for a DC motor so that the motor will brake or float when power is zero. Prototype Blockly Programming Mode has been added to FTC Robot Controller. Users can place the Robot Controller into this mode, and then use a device (such as a laptop) that has a Javascript enabled browser to write Blockly-based Op Modes directly onto the Robot Controller. Users can now configure the robot remotely through the FTC Driver Station app. Android Studio project supports Android Studio 2.1.x and compile SDK Version 23 (Marshmallow). Vuforia Computer Vision SDK integrated into FTC SDK. Users can use sample vision targets to get localization information on a standard FTC field. Project structure has been reorganized so that there is now a TeamCode package that users can use to place their local/custom Op Modes into this package. Inspection function has been integrated into the FTC Robot Controller and Driver Station Apps (Thanks Team HazMat… 9277 & 10650!). Audio cues have been incorporated into FTC SDK. Swap mechanism added to FTC Robot Controller configuration activity. For example, if you have two motor controllers on a robot, and you misidentified them in your configuration file, you can use the Swap button to swap the devices within the configuration file (so you do not have to manually re-enter in the configuration info for the two devices). Fix mechanism added to all user to replace an electronic module easily. For example, suppose a servo controller dies on your robot. You replace the broken module with a new module, which has a different serial number from the original servo controller. You can use the Fix button to automatically reconfigure your configuration file to use the serial number of the new module. Improvements made to fix resiliency and responsiveness of the system. For LinearOpMode the user now must for a telemetry.update() to update the telemetry data on the driver station. This update() mechanism ensures that the driver station gets the updated data properly and at the same time. The Auto Configure function of the Robot Controller is now template based. If there is a commonly used robot configuration, a template can be created so that the Auto Configure mechanism can be used to quickly configure a robot of this type. The logic to detect a runaway op mode (both in the LinearOpMode and OpMode types) and to abort the run, then auto recover has been improved/implemented. Fix has been incorporated so that Logitech F310 gamepad mappings will be correct for Marshmallow users. Release 16.07.08 For the ftc_app project, the gradle files have been modified to support Android Studio 2.1.x. Release 16.03.30 For the MIT App Inventor, the design blocks have new icons that better represent the function of each design component. Some changes were made to the shutdown logic to ensure the robust shutdown of some of our USB services. A change was made to LinearOpMode so as to allow a given instance to be executed more than once, which is required for the App Inventor. Javadoc improved/updated. Release 16.03.09 Changes made to make the FTC SDK synchronous (significant change!) waitOneFullHardwareCycle() and waitForNextHardwareCycle() are no longer needed and have been deprecated. runOpMode() (for a LinearOpMode) is now decoupled from the system's hardware read/write thread. loop() (for an OpMode) is now decoupled from the system's hardware read/write thread. Methods are synchronous. For example, if you call setMode(DcMotorController.RunMode.RESET_ENCODERS) for a motor, the encoder is guaranteed to be reset when the method call is complete. For legacy module (NXT compatible), user no longer has to toggle between read and write modes when reading from or writing to a legacy device. Changes made to enhance reliability/robustness during ESD event. Changes made to make code thread safe. Debug keystore added so that user-generated robot controller APKs will all use the same signed key (to avoid conflicts if a team has multiple developer laptops for example). Firmware version information for Modern Robotics modules are now logged. Changes made to improve USB comm reliability and robustness. Added support for voltage indicator for legacy (NXT-compatible) motor controllers. Changes made to provide auto stop capabilities for op modes. A LinearOpMode class will stop when the statements in runOpMode() are complete. User does not have to push the stop button on the driver station. If an op mode is stopped by the driver station, but there is a run away/uninterruptible thread persisting, the app will log an error message then force itself to crash to stop the runaway thread. Driver Station UI modified to display lowest measured voltage below current voltage (12V battery). Driver Station UI modified to have color background for current voltage (green=good, yellow=caution, red=danger, extremely low voltage). javadoc improved (edits and additional classes). Added app build time to About activity for driver station and robot controller apps. Display local IP addresses on Driver Station About activity. Added I2cDeviceSynchImpl. Added I2cDeviceSync interface. Added seconds() and milliseconds() to ElapsedTime for clarity. Added getCallbackCount() to I2cDevice. Added missing clearI2cPortActionFlag. Added code to create log messages while waiting for LinearOpMode shutdown. Fix so Wifi Direct Config activity will no longer launch multiple times. Added the ability to specify an alternate i2c address in software for the Modern Robotics gyro. Release 16.02.09 Improved battery checker feature so that voltage values get refreshed regularly (every 250 msec) on Driver Station (DS) user interface. Improved software so that Robot Controller (RC) is much more resilient and “self-healing” to USB disconnects: If user attempts to start/restart RC with one or more module missing, it will display a warning but still start up. When running an op mode, if one or more modules gets disconnected, the RC & DS will display warnings,and robot will keep on working in spite of the missing module(s). If a disconnected module gets physically reconnected the RC will auto detect the module and the user will regain control of the recently connected module. Warning messages are more helpful (identifies the type of module that’s missing plus its USB serial number). Code changes to fix the null gamepad reference when users try to reference the gamepads in the init() portion of their op mode. NXT light sensor output is now properly scaled. Note that teams might have to readjust their light threshold values in their op modes. On DS user interface, gamepad icon for a driver will disappear if the matching gamepad is disconnected or if that gamepad gets designated as a different driver. Robot Protocol (ROBOCOL) version number info is displayed in About screen on RC and DS apps. Incorporated a display filter on pairing screen to filter out devices that don’t use the “-“ format. This filter can be turned off to show all WiFi Direct devices. Updated text in License file. Fixed formatting error in OpticalDistanceSensor.toString(). Fixed issue on with a blank (“”) device name that would disrupt WiFi Direct Pairing. Made a change so that the WiFi info and battery info can be displayed more quickly on the DS upon connecting to RC. Improved javadoc generation. Modified code to make it easier to support language localization in the future. Release 16.01.04 Updated compileSdkVersion for apps Prevent Wifi from entering power saving mode removed unused import from driver station Corrrected \"Dead zone\" joystick code. LED.getDeviceName and .getConnectionInfo() return null apps check for ROBOCOL_VERSION mismatch Fix for Telemetry also has off-by-one errors in its data string sizing / short size limitations error User telemetry output is sorted. added formatting variants to DbgLog and RobotLog APIs code modified to allow for a long list of op mode names. changes to improve thread safety of RobocolDatagramSocket Fix for \"missing hardware leaves robot controller disconnected from driver station\" error fix for \"fast tapping of Init/Start causes problems\" (toast is now only instantiated on UI thread). added some log statements for thread life cycle. moved gamepad reset logic inside of initActiveOpMode() for robustness changes made to mitigate risk of race conditions on public methods. changes to try and flag when WiFi Direct name contains non-printable characters. fix to correct race condition between .run() and .close() in ReadWriteRunnableStandard. updated FTDI driver made ReadWriteRunnableStanard interface public. fixed off-by-one errors in Command constructor moved specific hardware implmentations into their own package. moved specific gamepad implemnatations to the hardware library. changed LICENSE file to new BSD version. fixed race condition when shutting down Modern Robotics USB devices. methods in the ColorSensor classes have been synchronized. corrected isBusy() status to reflect end of motion. corrected \"back\" button keycode. the notSupported() method of the GyroSensor class was changed to protected (it should not be public). Release 15.11.04.001 Added Support for Modern Robotics Gyro. The GyroSensor class now supports the MR Gyro Sensor. Users can access heading data (about Z axis) Users can also access raw gyro data (X, Y, & Z axes). Example MRGyroTest.java op mode included. Improved error messages More descriptive error messages for exceptions in user code. Updated DcMotor API Enable read mode on new address in setI2cAddress Fix so that driver station app resets the gamepads when switching op modes. USB-related code changes to make USB comm more responsive and to display more explicit error messages. Fix so that USB will recover properly if the USB bus returns garbage data. Fix USB initializtion race condition. Better error reporting during FTDI open. More explicit messages during USB failures. Fixed bug so that USB device is closed if event loop teardown method was not called. Fixed timer UI issue Fixed duplicate name UI bug (Legacy Module configuration). Fixed race condition in EventLoopManager. Fix to keep references stable when updating gamepad. For legacy Matrix motor/servo controllers removed necessity of appending \"Motor\" and \"Servo\" to controller names. Updated HT color sensor driver to use constants from ModernRoboticsUsbLegacyModule class. Updated MR color sensor driver to use constants from ModernRoboticsUsbDeviceInterfaceModule class. Correctly handle I2C Address change in all color sensors Updated/cleaned up op modes. Updated comments in LinearI2cAddressChange.java example op mode. Replaced the calls to \"setChannelMode\" with \"setMode\" (to match the new of the DcMotor method). Removed K9AutoTime.java op mode. Added MRGyroTest.java op mode (demonstrates how to use MR Gyro Sensor). Added MRRGBExample.java op mode (demonstrates how to use MR Color Sensor). Added HTRGBExample.java op mode (demonstrates how to use HT legacy color sensor). Added MatrixControllerDemo.java (demonstrates how to use legacy Matrix controller). Updated javadoc documentation. Updated release .apk files for Robot Controller and Driver Station apps. Release 15.10.06.002 Added support for Legacy Matrix 9.6V motor/servo controller. Cleaned up build.gradle file. Minor UI and bug fixes for driver station and robot controller apps. Throws error if Ultrasonic sensor (NXT) is not configured for legacy module port 4 or 5. Release 15.08.03.001 New user interfaces for FTC Driver Station and FTC Robot Controller apps. An init() method is added to the OpMode class. For this release, init() is triggered right before the start() method. Eventually, the init() method will be triggered when the user presses an \"INIT\" button on driver station. The init() and loop() methods are now required (i.e., need to be overridden in the user's op mode). The start() and stop() methods are optional. A new LinearOpMode class is introduced. Teams can use the LinearOpMode mode to create a linear (not event driven) program model. Teams can use blocking statements like Thread.sleep() within a linear op mode. The API for the Legacy Module and Core Device Interface Module have been updated. Support for encoders with the Legacy Module is now working. The hardware loop has been updated for better performance.",

    "content": "Quickstart tutorial Prerequisites Before reading this tutorial you should know a bit of Python. If you would like to refresh your memory, take a look at the Python tutorial.  If you wish to work the examples in this tutorial, you must also have some software installed on your computer. Please see https://scipy.org/install.html for instructions.  Learner profile  This tutorial is intended as a quick overview of algebra and arrays in NumPy and want to understand how n-dimensional (n>=2) arrays are represented and can be manipulated. In particular, if you don’t know how to apply common functions to n-dimensional arrays (without using for-loops), or if you want to understand axis and shape properties for n-dimensional arrays, this tutorial might be of help.  Learning Objectives  After this tutorial, you should be able to:  Understand the difference between one-, two- and n-dimensional arrays in NumPy;  Understand how to apply some linear algebra operations to n-dimensional arrays without using for-loops;  Understand axis and shape properties for n-dimensional arrays.  The Basics NumPy’s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. In NumPy dimensions are called axes.  For example, the coordinates of a point in 3D space [1, 2, 1] has one axis. That axis has 3 elements in it, so we say it has a length of 3. In the example pictured below, the array has 2 axes. The first axis has a length of 2, the second axis has a length of 3.  [[ 1., 0., 0.],  [ 0., 1., 2.]] NumPy’s array class is called ndarray. It is also known by the alias array. Note that numpy.array is not the same as the Standard Python Library class array.array, which only handles one-dimensional arrays and offers less functionality. The more important attributes of an ndarray object are:  ndarray.ndim the number of axes (dimensions) of the array.  ndarray.shape the dimensions of the array. This is a tuple of integers indicating the size of the array in each dimension. For a matrix with n rows and m columns, shape will be (n,m). The length of the shape tuple is therefore the number of axes, ndim.  ndarray.size the total number of elements of the array. This is equal to the product of the elements of shape.  ndarray.dtype an object describing the type of the elements in the array. One can create or specify dtype’s using standard Python types. Additionally NumPy provides types of its own. numpy.int32, numpy.int16, and numpy.float64 are some examples.  ndarray.itemsize the size in bytes of each element of the array. For example, an array of elements of type float64 has itemsize 8 (=64/8), while one of type complex32 has itemsize 4 (=32/8). It is equivalent to ndarray.dtype.itemsize.  ndarray.data the buffer containing the actual elements of the array. Normally, we won’t need to use this attribute because we will access the elements in an array using indexing facilities.  An example >>> import numpy as np a = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5) a array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],        [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9],        [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]]) a.shape (3, 5) a.ndim 2 a.dtype.name 'int64' a.itemsize 8 a.size 15 type(a) <class 'numpy.ndarray'> b = np.array([6, 7, 8]) b array([6, 7, 8]) type(b) <class 'numpy.ndarray'> Array Creation There are several ways to create arrays.  For example, you can create an array from a regular Python list or tuple using the array function. The type of the resulting array is deduced from the type of the elements in the sequences.  >>> >>> import numpy as np >>> a = np.array([2,3,4]) >>> a array([2, 3, 4]) >>> a.dtype dtype('int64') >>> b = np.array([1.2, 3.5, 5.1]) >>> b.dtype dtype('float64') A frequent error consists in calling array with multiple arguments, rather than providing a single sequence as an argument.  >>> >>> a = np.array(1,2,3,4)    # WRONG Traceback (most recent call last):   ... TypeError: array() takes from 1 to 2 positional arguments but 4 were given >>> a = np.array([1,2,3,4])  # RIGHT array transforms sequences of sequences into two-dimensional arrays, sequences of sequences of sequences into three-dimensional arrays, and so on.  >>> >>> b = np.array([(1.5,2,3), (4,5,6)]) >>> b array([[1.5, 2. , 3. ],        [4. , 5. , 6. ]]) The type of the array can also be explicitly specified at creation time:  >>> >>> c = np.array( [ [1,2], [3,4] ], dtype=complex ) >>> c array([[1.+0.j, 2.+0.j],        [3.+0.j, 4.+0.j]]) Often, the elements of an array are originally unknown, but its size is known. Hence, NumPy offers several functions to create arrays with initial placeholder content. These minimize the necessity of growing arrays, an expensive operation.  The function zeros creates an array full of zeros, the function ones creates an array full of ones, and the function empty creates an array whose initial content is random and depends on the state of the memory. By default, the dtype of the created array is float64.  >>> >>> np.zeros((3, 4)) array([[0., 0., 0., 0.],        [0., 0., 0., 0.],        [0., 0., 0., 0.]]) >>> np.ones( (2,3,4), dtype=np.int16 )                # dtype can also be specified array([[[1, 1, 1, 1],         [1, 1, 1, 1],         [1, 1, 1, 1]],         [[1, 1, 1, 1],         [1, 1, 1, 1],         [1, 1, 1, 1]]], dtype=int16) >>> np.empty( (2,3) )                                 # uninitialized array([[  3.73603959e-262,   6.02658058e-154,   6.55490914e-260],  # may vary        [  5.30498948e-313,   3.14673309e-307,   1.00000000e+000]]) To create sequences of numbers, NumPy provides the arange function which is analogous to the Python built-in range, but returns an array.  >>> >>> np.arange( 10, 30, 5 ) array([10, 15, 20, 25]) >>> np.arange( 0, 2, 0.3 )                 # it accepts float arguments array([0. , 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8]) When arange is used with floating point arguments, it is generally not possible to predict the number of elements obtained, due to the finite floating point precision. For this reason, it is usually better to use the function linspace that receives as an argument the number of elements that we want, instead of the step:  >>> >>> from numpy import pi >>> np.linspace( 0, 2, 9 )                 # 9 numbers from 0 to 2 array([0.  , 0.25, 0.5 , 0.75, 1.  , 1.25, 1.5 , 1.75, 2.  ]) >>> x = np.linspace( 0, 2*pi, 100 )        # useful to evaluate function at lots of points >>> f = np.sin(x) See also array, zeros, zeros_like, ones, ones_like, empty, empty_like, arange, linspace, numpy.random.Generator.rand, numpy.random.Generator.randn, fromfunction, fromfile  Printing Arrays When you print an array, NumPy displays it in a similar way to nested lists, but with the following layout:  the last axis is printed from left to right,  the second-to-last is printed from top to bottom,  the rest are also printed from top to bottom, with each slice separated from the next by an empty line.  One-dimensional arrays are then printed as rows, bidimensionals as matrices and tridimensionals as lists of matrices.  >>> >>> a = np.arange(6)                         # 1d array >>> print(a) [0 1 2 3 4 5] >>> >>> b = np.arange(12).reshape(4,3)           # 2d array >>> print(b) [[ 0  1  2]  [ 3  4  5]  [ 6  7  8]  [ 9 10 11]] >>> >>> c = np.arange(24).reshape(2,3,4)         # 3d array >>> print(c) [[[ 0  1  2  3]   [ 4  5  6  7]   [ 8  9 10 11]]   [[12 13 14 15]   [16 17 18 19]   [20 21 22 23]]] See below to get more details on reshape.  If an array is too large to be printed, NumPy automatically skips the central part of the array and only prints the corners:  >>> >>> print(np.arange(10000)) [   0    1    2 ... 9997 9998 9999] >>> >>> print(np.arange(10000).reshape(100,100)) [[   0    1    2 ...   97   98   99]  [ 100  101  102 ...  197  198  199]  [ 200  201  202 ...  297  298  299]  ...  [9700 9701 9702 ... 9797 9798 9799]  [9800 9801 9802 ... 9897 9898 9899]  [9900 9901 9902 ... 9997 9998 9999]] To disable this behaviour and force NumPy to print the entire array, you can change the printing options using set_printoptions.  >>> >>> np.set_printoptions(threshold=sys.maxsize)       # sys module should be imported Basic Operations Arithmetic operators on arrays apply elementwise. A new array is created and filled with the result.  >>> >>> a = np.array( [20,30,40,50] ) >>> b = np.arange( 4 ) >>> b array([0, 1, 2, 3]) >>> c = a-b >>> c array([20, 29, 38, 47]) >>> b**2 array([0, 1, 4, 9]) >>> 10*np.sin(a) array([ 9.12945251, -9.88031624,  7.4511316 , -2.62374854]) >>> a<35 array([ True,  True, False, False]) Unlike in many matrix languages, the product operator * operates elementwise in NumPy arrays. The matrix product can be performed using the @ operator (in python >=3.5) or the dot function or method:  >>> >>> A = np.array( [[1,1], ...                [0,1]] ) >>> B = np.array( [[2,0], ...                [3,4]] ) >>> A * B                       # elementwise product array([[2, 0],        [0, 4]]) >>> A @ B                       # matrix product array([[5, 4],        [3, 4]]) >>> A.dot(B)                    # another matrix product array([[5, 4],        [3, 4]]) Some operations, such as += and *=, act in place to modify an existing array rather than create a new one.  >>> >>> rg = np.random.default_rng(1)     # create instance of default random number generator >>> a = np.ones((2,3), dtype=int) >>> b = rg.random((2,3)) >>> a *= 3 >>> a array([[3, 3, 3],        [3, 3, 3]]) >>> b += a >>> b array([[3.51182162, 3.9504637 , 3.14415961],        [3.94864945, 3.31183145, 3.42332645]]) >>> a += b                            # b is not automatically converted to integer type Traceback (most recent call last):     ... numpy.core._exceptions.UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'add' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') with casting rule 'same_kind' When operating with arrays of different types, the type of the resulting array corresponds to the more general or precise one (a behavior known as upcasting).  >>> >>> a = np.ones(3, dtype=np.int32) >>> b = np.linspace(0,pi,3) >>> b.dtype.name 'float64' >>> c = a+b >>> c array([1.        , 2.57079633, 4.14159265]) >>> c.dtype.name 'float64' >>> d = np.exp(c*1j) >>> d array([ 0.54030231+0.84147098j, -0.84147098+0.54030231j,        -0.54030231-0.84147098j]) >>> d.dtype.name 'complex128' Many unary operations, such as computing the sum of all the elements in the array, are implemented as methods of the ndarray class.  >>> >>> a = rg.random((2,3)) >>> a array([[0.82770259, 0.40919914, 0.54959369],        [0.02755911, 0.75351311, 0.53814331]]) >>> a.sum() 3.1057109529998157 >>> a.min() 0.027559113243068367 >>> a.max() 0.8277025938204418 By default, these operations apply to the array as though it were a list of numbers, regardless of its shape. However, by specifying the axis parameter you can apply an operation along the specified axis of an array:  >>> >>> b = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4) >>> b array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],        [ 4,  5,  6,  7],        [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]) >>> >>> b.sum(axis=0)                            # sum of each column array([12, 15, 18, 21]) >>> >>> b.min(axis=1)                            # min of each row array([0, 4, 8]) >>> >>> b.cumsum(axis=1)                         # cumulative sum along each row array([[ 0,  1,  3,  6],        [ 4,  9, 15, 22],        [ 8, 17, 27, 38]]) Universal Functions NumPy provides familiar mathematical functions such as sin, cos, and exp. In NumPy, these are called “universal functions”(ufunc). Within NumPy, these functions operate elementwise on an array, producing an array as output.  >>> >>> B = np.arange(3) >>> B array([0, 1, 2]) >>> np.exp(B) array([1.        , 2.71828183, 7.3890561 ]) >>> np.sqrt(B) array([0.        , 1.        , 1.41421356]) >>> C = np.array([2., -1., 4.]) >>> np.add(B, C) array([2., 0., 6.]) See also all, any, apply_along_axis, argmax, argmin, argsort, average, bincount, ceil, clip, conj, corrcoef, cov, cross, cumprod, cumsum, diff, dot, floor, inner, invert, lexsort, max, maximum, mean, median, min, minimum, nonzero, outer, prod, re, round, sort, std, sum, trace, transpose, var, vdot, vectorize, where  Indexing, Slicing and Iterating One-dimensional arrays can be indexed, sliced and iterated over, much like lists and other Python sequences.  >>> >>> a = np.arange(10)**3 >>> a array([  0,   1,   8,  27,  64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729]) >>> a[2] 8 >>> a[2:5] array([ 8, 27, 64]) # equivalent to a[0:6:2] = 1000; # from start to position 6, exclusive, set every 2nd element to 1000 >>> a[:6:2] = 1000 >>> a array([1000,    1, 1000,   27, 1000,  125,  216,  343,  512,  729]) >>> a[ : :-1]                                 # reversed a array([ 729,  512,  343,  216,  125, 1000,   27, 1000,    1, 1000]) >>> for i in a: ...     print(i**(1/3.)) ... 9.999999999999998 1.0 9.999999999999998 3.0 9.999999999999998 4.999999999999999 5.999999999999999 6.999999999999999 7.999999999999999 8.999999999999998 Multidimensional arrays can have one index per axis. These indices are given in a tuple separated by commas:  >>> >>> def f(x,y): ...     return 10*x+y ... >>> b = np.fromfunction(f,(5,4),dtype=int) >>> b array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],        [10, 11, 12, 13],        [20, 21, 22, 23],        [30, 31, 32, 33],        [40, 41, 42, 43]]) >>> b[2,3] 23 >>> b[0:5, 1]                       # each row in the second column of b array([ 1, 11, 21, 31, 41]) >>> b[ : ,1]                        # equivalent to the previous example array([ 1, 11, 21, 31, 41]) >>> b[1:3, : ]                      # each column in the second and third row of b array([[10, 11, 12, 13],        [20, 21, 22, 23]]) When fewer indices are provided than the number of axes, the missing indices are considered complete slices:  >>> >>> b[-1]                                  # the last row. Equivalent to b[-1,:] array([40, 41, 42, 43]) The expression within brackets in b[i] is treated as an i followed by as many instances of : as needed to represent the remaining axes. NumPy also allows you to write this using dots as b[i,...].  The dots (...) represent as many colons as needed to produce a complete indexing tuple. For example, if x is an array with 5 axes, then  x[1,2,...] is equivalent to x[1,2,:,:,:],  x[...,3] to x[:,:,:,:,3] and  x[4,...,5,:] to x[4,:,:,5,:].  >>> >>> c = np.array( [[[  0,  1,  2],               # a 3D array (two stacked 2D arrays) ...                 [ 10, 12, 13]], ...                [[100,101,102], ...                 [110,112,113]]]) >>> c.shape (2, 2, 3) >>> c[1,...]                                   # same as c[1,:,:] or c[1] array([[100, 101, 102],        [110, 112, 113]]) >>> c[...,2]                                   # same as c[:,:,2] array([[  2,  13],        [102, 113]]) Iterating over multidimensional arrays is done with respect to the first axis:  >>> >>> for row in b: ...     print(row) ... [0 1 2 3] [10 11 12 13] [20 21 22 23] [30 31 32 33] [40 41 42 43] However, if one wants to perform an operation on each element in the array, one can use the flat attribute which is an iterator over all the elements of the array:  >>> >>> for element in b.flat: ...     print(element) ... 0 1 2 3 10 11 12 13 20 21 22 23 30 31 32 33 40 41 42 43 See also Indexing, Indexing (reference), newaxis, ndenumerate, indices  Shape Manipulation Changing the shape of an array An array has a shape given by the number of elements along each axis:  >>> >>> a = np.floor(10*rg.random((3,4))) >>> a array([[3., 7., 3., 4.],        [1., 4., 2., 2.],        [7., 2., 4., 9.]]) >>> a.shape (3, 4) The shape of an array can be changed with various commands. Note that the following three commands all return a modified array, but do not change the original array:  >>> >>> a.ravel()  # returns the array, flattened array([3., 7., 3., 4., 1., 4., 2., 2., 7., 2., 4., 9.]) >>> a.reshape(6,2)  # returns the array with a modified shape array([[3., 7.],        [3., 4.],        [1., 4.],        [2., 2.],        [7., 2.],        [4., 9.]]) >>> a.T  # returns the array, transposed array([[3., 1., 7.],        [7., 4., 2.],        [3., 2., 4.],        [4., 2., 9.]]) >>> a.T.shape (4, 3) >>> a.shape (3, 4) The order of the elements in the array resulting from ravel() is normally “C-style”, that is, the rightmost index “changes the fastest”, so the element after a[0,0] is a[0,1]. If the array is reshaped to some other shape, again the array is treated as “C-style”. NumPy normally creates arrays stored in this order, so ravel() will usually not need to copy its argument, but if the array was made by taking slices of another array or created with unusual options, it may need to be copied. The functions ravel() and reshape() can also be instructed, using an optional argument, to use FORTRAN-style arrays, in which the leftmost index changes the fastest.  The reshape function returns its argument with a modified shape, whereas the ndarray.resize method modifies the array itself:  >>> >>> a array([[3., 7., 3., 4.],        [1., 4., 2., 2.],        [7., 2., 4., 9.]]) >>> a.resize((2,6)) >>> a array([[3., 7., 3., 4., 1., 4.],        [2., 2., 7., 2., 4., 9.]]) If a dimension is given as -1 in a reshaping operation, the other dimensions are automatically calculated:  >>> >>> a.reshape(3,-1) array([[3., 7., 3., 4.],        [1., 4., 2., 2.],        [7., 2., 4., 9.]]) See also ndarray.shape, reshape, resize, ravel  Stacking together different arrays Several arrays can be stacked together along different axes:  >>> >>> a = np.floor(10*rg.random((2,2))) >>> a array([[9., 7.],        [5., 2.]]) >>> b = np.floor(10*rg.random((2,2))) >>> b array([[1., 9.],        [5., 1.]]) >>> np.vstack((a,b)) array([[9., 7.],        [5., 2.],        [1., 9.],        [5., 1.]]) >>> np.hstack((a,b)) array([[9., 7., 1., 9.],        [5., 2., 5., 1.]]) The function column_stack stacks 1D arrays as columns into a 2D array. It is equivalent to hstack only for 2D arrays:  >>> >>> from numpy import newaxis >>> np.column_stack((a,b))     # with 2D arrays array([[9., 7., 1., 9.],        [5., 2., 5., 1.]]) >>> a = np.array([4.,2.]) >>> b = np.array([3.,8.]) >>> np.column_stack((a,b))     # returns a 2D array array([[4., 3.],        [2., 8.]]) >>> np.hstack((a,b))           # the result is different array([4., 2., 3., 8.]) >>> a[:,newaxis]               # view `a` as a 2D column vector array([[4.],        [2.]]) >>> np.column_stack((a[:,newaxis],b[:,newaxis])) array([[4., 3.],        [2., 8.]]) >>> np.hstack((a[:,newaxis],b[:,newaxis]))   # the result is the same array([[4., 3.],        [2., 8.]]) On the other hand, the function row_stack is equivalent to vstack for any input arrays. In fact, row_stack is an alias for vstack:  >>> >>> np.column_stack is np.hstack False >>> np.row_stack is np.vstack True In general, for arrays with more than two dimensions, hstack stacks along their second axes, vstack stacks along their first axes, and concatenate allows for an optional arguments giving the number of the axis along which the concatenation should happen.  Note  In complex cases, r_ and c_ are useful for creating arrays by stacking numbers along one axis. They allow the use of range literals (“:”)  >>> >>> np.r_[1:4,0,4] array([1, 2, 3, 0, 4]) When used with arrays as arguments, r_ and c_ are similar to vstack and hstack in their default behavior, but allow for an optional argument giving the number of the axis along which to concatenate.  See also hstack, vstack, column_stack, concatenate, c_, r_  Splitting one array into several smaller ones Using hsplit, you can split an array along its horizontal axis, either by specifying the number of equally shaped arrays to return, or by specifying the columns after which the division should occur:  >>> >>> a = np.floor(10*rg.random((2,12))) >>> a array([[6., 7., 6., 9., 0., 5., 4., 0., 6., 8., 5., 2.],        [8., 5., 5., 7., 1., 8., 6., 7., 1., 8., 1., 0.]]) # Split a into 3 >>> np.hsplit(a,3) [array([[6., 7., 6., 9.],        [8., 5., 5., 7.]]), array([[0., 5., 4., 0.],        [1., 8., 6., 7.]]), array([[6., 8., 5., 2.],        [1., 8., 1., 0.]])] # Split a after the third and the fourth column >>> np.hsplit(a,(3,4)) [array([[6., 7., 6.],        [8., 5., 5.]]), array([[9.],        [7.]]), array([[0., 5., 4., 0., 6., 8., 5., 2.],        [1., 8., 6., 7., 1., 8., 1., 0.]])] vsplit splits along the vertical axis, and array_split allows one to specify along which axis to split.  Copies and Views When operating and manipulating arrays, their data is sometimes copied into a new array and sometimes not. This is often a source of confusion for beginners. There are three cases:  No Copy at All Simple assignments make no copy of objects or their data.  >>> >>> a = np.array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3], ...               [ 4,  5,  6,  7], ...               [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]) >>> b = a            # no new object is created >>> b is a           # a and b are two names for the same ndarray object True Python passes mutable objects as references, so function calls make no copy.  >>> >>> def f(x): ...     print(id(x)) ... >>> id(a)                           # id is a unique identifier of an object 148293216  # may vary >>> f(a) 148293216  # may vary View or Shallow Copy Different array objects can share the same data. The view method creates a new array object that looks at the same data.  >>> >>> c = a.view() >>> c is a False >>> c.base is a                        # c is a view of the data owned by a True >>> c.flags.owndata False >>> >>> c = c.reshape((2, 6))                      # a's shape doesn't change >>> a.shape (3, 4) >>> c[0, 4] = 1234                      # a's data changes >>> a array([[   0,    1,    2,    3],        [1234,    5,    6,    7],        [   8,    9,   10,   11]]) Slicing an array returns a view of it:  >>> >>> s = a[ : , 1:3]     # spaces added for clarity; could also be written \"s = a[:, 1:3]\" >>> s[:] = 10           # s[:] is a view of s. Note the difference between s = 10 and s[:] = 10 >>> a array([[   0,   10,   10,    3],        [1234,   10,   10,    7],        [   8,   10,   10,   11]]) Deep Copy The copy method makes a complete copy of the array and its data.  >>> >>> d = a.copy()                          # a new array object with new data is created >>> d is a False >>> d.base is a                           # d doesn't share anything with a False >>> d[0,0] = 9999 >>> a array([[   0,   10,   10,    3],        [1234,   10,   10,    7],        [   8,   10,   10,   11]]) Sometimes copy should be called after slicing if the original array is not required anymore. For example, suppose a is a huge intermediate result and the final result b only contains a small fraction of a, a deep copy should be made when constructing b with slicing:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(int(1e8)) >>> b = a[:100].copy() >>> del a  # the memory of ``a`` can be released. If b = a[:100] is used instead, a is referenced by b and will persist in memory even if del a is executed.

The first rule of broadcasting is that if all input arrays do not have the same number of dimensions, a “1” will be repeatedly prepended to the shapes of the smaller arrays until all the arrays have the same number of dimensions.  The second rule of broadcasting ensures that arrays with a size of 1 along a particular dimension act as if they had the size of the array with the largest shape along that dimension. The value of the array element is assumed to be the same along that dimension for the “broadcast” array.  After application of the broadcasting rules, the sizes of all arrays must match. More details can be found in Broadcasting.  Advanced indexing and index tricks NumPy offers more indexing facilities than regular Python sequences. In addition to indexing by integers and slices, as we saw before, arrays can be indexed by arrays of integers and arrays of booleans.  Indexing with Arrays of Indices >>> >>> a = np.arange(12)**2                       # the first 12 square numbers >>> i = np.array([1, 1, 3, 8, 5])              # an array of indices >>> a[i]                                       # the elements of a at the positions i array([ 1,  1,  9, 64, 25]) >>> >>> j = np.array([[3, 4], [9, 7]])      # a bidimensional array of indices >>> a[j]                                       # the same shape as j array([[ 9, 16],        [81, 49]]) When the indexed array a is multidimensional, a single array of indices refers to the first dimension of a. The following example shows this behavior by converting an image of labels into a color image using a palette.  >>> >>> palette = np.array([[0, 0, 0],         # black ...                     [255, 0, 0],       # red ...                     [0, 255, 0],       # green ...                     [0, 0, 255],       # blue ...                     [255, 255, 255]])  # white >>> image = np.array([[0, 1, 2, 0],        # each value corresponds to a color in the palette ...                   [0, 3, 4, 0]]) >>> palette[image]                         # the (2, 4, 3) color image array([[[  0,   0,   0],         [255,   0,   0],         [  0, 255,   0],         [  0,   0,   0]],         [[  0,   0,   0],         [  0,   0, 255],         [255, 255, 255],         [  0,   0,   0]]]) We can also give indexes for more than one dimension. The arrays of indices for each dimension must have the same shape.  >>> >>> a = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4) >>> a array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],        [ 4,  5,  6,  7],        [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]) >>> i = np.array([[0, 1],                     # indices for the first dim of a ...               [1, 2]]) >>> j = np.array([[2, 1],                     # indices for the second dim ...               [3, 3]]) >>> >>> a[i, j]                                   # i and j must have equal shape array([[ 2,  5],        [ 7, 11]]) >>> >>> a[i, 2] array([[ 2,  6],        [ 6, 10]]) >>> >>> a[:, j]                                     # i.e., a[ : , j] array([[[ 2,  1],         [ 3,  3]],         [[ 6,  5],         [ 7,  7]],         [[10,  9],         [11, 11]]]) In Python, arr[i, j] is exactly the same as arr[(i, j)]—so we can put i and j in a tuple and then do the indexing with that.  >>> >>> l = (i, j) # equivalent to a[i, j] >>> a[l] array([[ 2,  5],        [ 7, 11]]) However, we can not do this by putting i and j into an array, because this array will be interpreted as indexing the first dimension of a.  >>> >>> s = np.array([i, j])  # not what we want >>> a[s] Traceback (most recent call last):   File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module> IndexError: index 3 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 3  # same as a[i, j] >>> a[tuple(s)] array([[ 2,  5],        [ 7, 11]]) Another common use of indexing with arrays is the search of the maximum value of time-dependent series:  >>> >>> time = np.linspace(20, 145, 5)                 # time scale >>> data = np.sin(np.arange(20)).reshape(5,4)      # 4 time-dependent series >>> time array([ 20.  ,  51.25,  82.5 , 113.75, 145.  ]) >>> data array([[ 0.        ,  0.84147098,  0.90929743,  0.14112001],        [-0.7568025 , -0.95892427, -0.2794155 ,  0.6569866 ],        [ 0.98935825,  0.41211849, -0.54402111, -0.99999021],        [-0.53657292,  0.42016704,  0.99060736,  0.65028784],        [-0.28790332, -0.96139749, -0.75098725,  0.14987721]])  # index of the maxima for each series >>> ind = data.argmax(axis=0) >>> ind array([2, 0, 3, 1])  # times corresponding to the maxima >>> time_max = time[ind] >>> >>> data_max = data[ind, range(data.shape[1])] # => data[ind[0],0], data[ind[1],1]...  >>> time_max array([ 82.5 ,  20.  , 113.75,  51.25]) >>> data_max array([0.98935825, 0.84147098, 0.99060736, 0.6569866 ])  >>> np.all(data_max == data.max(axis=0)) True You can also use indexing with arrays as a target to assign to:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(5) >>> a array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) >>> a[[1,3,4]] = 0 >>> a array([0, 0, 2, 0, 0]) However, when the list of indices contains repetitions, the assignment is done several times, leaving behind the last value:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(5) >>> a[[0,0,2]]=[1,2,3] >>> a array([2, 1, 3, 3, 4]) This is reasonable enough, but watch out if you want to use Python’s += construct, as it may not do what you expect:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(5) >>> a[[0,0,2]]+=1 >>> a array([1, 1, 3, 3, 4]) Even though 0 occurs twice in the list of indices, the 0th element is only incremented once. This is because Python requires “a+=1” to be equivalent to “a = a + 1”.  Indexing with Boolean Arrays When we index arrays with arrays of (integer) indices we are providing the list of indices to pick. With boolean indices the approach is different; we explicitly choose which items in the array we want and which ones we don’t.  The most natural way one can think of for boolean indexing is to use boolean arrays that have the same shape as the original array:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4) >>> b = a > 4 >>> b                                          # b is a boolean with a's shape array([[False, False, False, False],        [False,  True,  True,  True],        [ True,  True,  True,  True]]) >>> a[b]                                       # 1d array with the selected elements array([ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11]) This property can be very useful in assignments:  >>> >>> a[b] = 0                                   # All elements of 'a' higher than 4 become 0 >>> a array([[0, 1, 2, 3],        [4, 0, 0, 0],        [0, 0, 0, 0]]) You can look at the following example to see how to use boolean indexing to generate an image of the Mandelbrot set:  >>> import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def mandelbrot( h,w, maxit=20 ):     \"\"\"Returns an image of the Mandelbrot fractal of size (h,w).\"\"\"     y,x = np.ogrid[ -1.4:1.4:h*1j, -2:0.8:w*1j ]     c = x+y*1j     z = c     divtime = maxit + np.zeros(z.shape, dtype=int)      for i in range(maxit):         z = z**2 + c         diverge = z*np.conj(z) > 2**2            # who is diverging         div_now = diverge & (divtime==maxit)  # who is diverging now         divtime[div_now] = i                  # note when         z[diverge] = 2                        # avoid diverging too much      return divtime plt.imshow(mandelbrot(400,400)) ../_images/quickstart-1.png The second way of indexing with booleans is more similar to integer indexing; for each dimension of the array we give a 1D boolean array selecting the slices we want:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4) >>> b1 = np.array([False,True,True])             # first dim selection >>> b2 = np.array([True,False,True,False])       # second dim selection >>> >>> a[b1,:]                                   # selecting rows array([[ 4,  5,  6,  7],        [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]) >>> >>> a[b1]                                     # same thing array([[ 4,  5,  6,  7],        [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]) >>> >>> a[:,b2]                                   # selecting columns array([[ 0,  2],        [ 4,  6],        [ 8, 10]]) >>> >>> a[b1,b2]                                  # a weird thing to do array([ 4, 10]) Note that the length of the 1D boolean array must coincide with the length of the dimension (or axis) you want to slice. In the previous example, b1 has length 3 (the number of rows in a), and b2 (of length 4) is suitable to index the 2nd axis (columns) of a.  The ix_() function The ix_ function can be used to combine different vectors so as to obtain the result for each n-uplet. For example, if you want to compute all the a+b*c for all the triplets taken from each of the vectors a, b and c:  >>> >>> a = np.array([2,3,4,5]) >>> b = np.array([8,5,4]) >>> c = np.array([5,4,6,8,3]) >>> ax,bx,cx = np.ix_(a,b,c) >>> ax array([[[2]],         [[3]],         [[4]],         [[5]]]) >>> bx array([[[8],         [5],         [4]]]) >>> cx array([[[5, 4, 6, 8, 3]]]) >>> ax.shape, bx.shape, cx.shape ((4, 1, 1), (1, 3, 1), (1, 1, 5)) >>> result = ax+bx*cx >>> result array([[[42, 34, 50, 66, 26],         [27, 22, 32, 42, 17],         [22, 18, 26, 34, 14]],         [[43, 35, 51, 67, 27],         [28, 23, 33, 43, 18],         [23, 19, 27, 35, 15]],         [[44, 36, 52, 68, 28],         [29, 24, 34, 44, 19],         [24, 20, 28, 36, 16]],         [[45, 37, 53, 69, 29],         [30, 25, 35, 45, 20],         [25, 21, 29, 37, 17]]]) >>> result[3,2,4] 17 >>> a[3]+b[2]*c[4] 17 You could also implement the reduce as follows:  >>> >>> def ufunc_reduce(ufct, *vectors): ...    vs = np.ix_(*vectors) ...    r = ufct.identity ...    for v in vs: ...        r = ufct(r,v) ...    return r and then use it as:  >>> >>> ufunc_reduce(np.add,a,b,c) array([[[15, 14, 16, 18, 13],         [12, 11, 13, 15, 10],         [11, 10, 12, 14,  9]],         [[16, 15, 17, 19, 14],         [13, 12, 14, 16, 11],         [12, 11, 13, 15, 10]],         [[17, 16, 18, 20, 15],         [14, 13, 15, 17, 12],         [13, 12, 14, 16, 11]],         [[18, 17, 19, 21, 16],         [15, 14, 16, 18, 13],         [14, 13, 15, 17, 12]]]) The advantage of this version of reduce compared to the normal ufunc.reduce is that it makes use of the Broadcasting Rules in order to avoid creating an argument array the size of the output times the number of vectors.  Indexing with strings See Structured arrays.  Linear Algebra Work in progress. Basic linear algebra to be included here.  Simple Array Operations See linalg.py in numpy folder for more.  >>> >>> import numpy as np >>> a = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]) >>> print(a) [[1. 2.]  [3. 4.]]  >>> a.transpose() array([[1., 3.],        [2., 4.]])  >>> np.linalg.inv(a) array([[-2. ,  1. ],        [ 1.5, -0.5]])  >>> u = np.eye(2) # unit 2x2 matrix; \"eye\" represents \"I\" >>> u array([[1., 0.],        [0., 1.]]) >>> j = np.array([[0.0, -1.0], [1.0, 0.0]])  >>> j @ j        # matrix product array([[-1.,  0.],        [ 0., -1.]])  >>> np.trace(u)  # trace 2.0  >>> y = np.array([[5.], [7.]]) >>> np.linalg.solve(a, y) array([[-3.],        [ 4.]])  >>> np.linalg.eig(j) (array([0.+1.j, 0.-1.j]), array([[0.70710678+0.j        , 0.70710678-0.j        ],        [0.        -0.70710678j, 0.        +0.70710678j]])) Parameters:     square matrix Returns     The eigenvalues, each repeated according to its multiplicity.     The normalized (unit \"length\") eigenvectors, such that the     column ``v[:,i]`` is the eigenvector corresponding to the     eigenvalue ``w[i]`` . Tricks and Tips Here we give a list of short and useful tips.  “Automatic” Reshaping To change the dimensions of an array, you can omit one of the sizes which will then be deduced automatically:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(30) >>> b = a.reshape((2, -1, 3))  # -1 means \"whatever is needed\" >>> b.shape (2, 5, 3) >>> b array([[[ 0,  1,  2],         [ 3,  4,  5],         [ 6,  7,  8],         [ 9, 10, 11],         [12, 13, 14]],         [[15, 16, 17],         [18, 19, 20],         [21, 22, 23],         [24, 25, 26],         [27, 28, 29]]]) Vector Stacking How do we construct a 2D array from a list of equally-sized row vectors? In MATLAB this is quite easy: if x and y are two vectors of the same length you only need do m=[x;y]. In NumPy this works via the functions column_stack, dstack, hstack and vstack, depending on the dimension in which the stacking is to be done. For example:  >>> >>> x = np.arange(0,10,2) >>> y = np.arange(5) >>> m = np.vstack([x,y]) >>> m array([[0, 2, 4, 6, 8],        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]]) >>> xy = np.hstack([x,y]) >>> xy array([0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) The logic behind those functions in more than two dimensions can be strange.  See also NumPy for Matlab users  Histograms The NumPy histogram function applied to an array returns a pair of vectors: the histogram of the array and a vector of the bin edges. Beware: matplotlib also has a function to build histograms (called hist, as in Matlab) that differs from the one in NumPy. The main difference is that pylab.hist plots the histogram automatically, while numpy.histogram only generates the data.  >>> import numpy as np rg = np.random.default_rng(1) import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Build a vector of 10000 normal deviates with variance 0.5^2 and mean 2 mu, sigma = 2, 0.5 v = rg.normal(mu,sigma,10000) # Plot a normalized histogram with 50 bins plt.hist(v, bins=50, density=1)       # matplotlib version (plot) # Compute the histogram with numpy and then plot it (n, bins) = np.histogram(v, bins=50, density=True)  # NumPy version (no plot) plt.plot(.5*(bins[1:]+bins[:-1]), n) ../_images/quickstart-2.png Further reading The Python tutorial  NumPy Reference  SciPy Tutorial  SciPy Lecture Notes  A matlab, R, IDL, NumPy/SciPy dictionary  © Copyright 2008-2020, The SciPy community.

    "content": "Quickstart tutorial Prerequisites Before reading this tutorial you should know a bit of Python. If you would like to refresh your memory, take a look at the Python tutorial.  If you wish to work the examples in this tutorial, you must also have some software installed on your computer. Please see https://scipy.org/install.html for instructions.  Learner profile  This tutorial is intended as a quick overview of algebra and arrays in NumPy and want to understand how n-dimensional (n>=2) arrays are represented and can be manipulated. In particular, if you don’t know how to apply common functions to n-dimensional arrays (without using for-loops), or if you want to understand axis and shape properties for n-dimensional arrays, this tutorial might be of help.  Learning Objectives  After this tutorial, you should be able to:  Understand the difference between one-, two- and n-dimensional arrays in NumPy;  Understand how to apply some linear algebra operations to n-dimensional arrays without using for-loops;  Understand axis and shape properties for n-dimensional arrays.  The Basics NumPy’s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. In NumPy dimensions are called axes.  For example, the coordinates of a point in 3D space [1, 2, 1] has one axis. That axis has 3 elements in it, so we say it has a length of 3. In the example pictured below, the array has 2 axes. The first axis has a length of 2, the second axis has a length of 3.  [[ 1., 0., 0.],  [ 0., 1., 2.]] NumPy’s array class is called ndarray. It is also known by the alias array. Note that numpy.array is not the same as the Standard Python Library class array.array, which only handles one-dimensional arrays and offers less functionality. The more important attributes of an ndarray object are:  ndarray.ndim the number of axes (dimensions) of the array.  ndarray.shape the dimensions of the array. This is a tuple of integers indicating the size of the array in each dimension. For a matrix with n rows and m columns, shape will be (n,m). The length of the shape tuple is therefore the number of axes, ndim.  ndarray.size the total number of elements of the array. This is equal to the product of the elements of shape.  ndarray.dtype an object describing the type of the elements in the array. One can create or specify dtype’s using standard Python types. Additionally NumPy provides types of its own. numpy.int32, numpy.int16, and numpy.float64 are some examples.  ndarray.itemsize the size in bytes of each element of the array. For example, an array of elements of type float64 has itemsize 8 (=64/8), while one of type complex32 has itemsize 4 (=32/8). It is equivalent to ndarray.dtype.itemsize.  ndarray.data the buffer containing the actual elements of the array. Normally, we won’t need to use this attribute because we will access the elements in an array using indexing facilities.  An example >>> import numpy as np a = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5) a array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],        [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9],        [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]]) a.shape (3, 5) a.ndim 2 a.dtype.name 'int64' a.itemsize 8 a.size 15 type(a) <class 'numpy.ndarray'> b = np.array([6, 7, 8]) b array([6, 7, 8]) type(b) <class 'numpy.ndarray'> Array Creation There are several ways to create arrays.  For example, you can create an array from a regular Python list or tuple using the array function. The type of the resulting array is deduced from the type of the elements in the sequences.  >>> >>> import numpy as np >>> a = np.array([2,3,4]) >>> a array([2, 3, 4]) >>> a.dtype dtype('int64') >>> b = np.array([1.2, 3.5, 5.1]) >>> b.dtype dtype('float64') A frequent error consists in calling array with multiple arguments, rather than providing a single sequence as an argument.  >>> >>> a = np.array(1,2,3,4)    # WRONG Traceback (most recent call last):   ... TypeError: array() takes from 1 to 2 positional arguments but 4 were given >>> a = np.array([1,2,3,4])  # RIGHT array transforms sequences of sequences into two-dimensional arrays, sequences of sequences of sequences into three-dimensional arrays, and so on.  >>> >>> b = np.array([(1.5,2,3), (4,5,6)]) >>> b array([[1.5, 2. , 3. ],        [4. , 5. , 6. ]]) The type of the array can also be explicitly specified at creation time:  >>> >>> c = np.array( [ [1,2], [3,4] ], dtype=complex ) >>> c array([[1.+0.j, 2.+0.j],        [3.+0.j, 4.+0.j]]) Often, the elements of an array are originally unknown, but its size is known. Hence, NumPy offers several functions to create arrays with initial placeholder content. These minimize the necessity of growing arrays, an expensive operation.  The function zeros creates an array full of zeros, the function ones creates an array full of ones, and the function empty creates an array whose initial content is random and depends on the state of the memory. By default, the dtype of the created array is float64.  >>> >>> np.zeros((3, 4)) array([[0., 0., 0., 0.],        [0., 0., 0., 0.],        [0., 0., 0., 0.]]) >>> np.ones( (2,3,4), dtype=np.int16 )                # dtype can also be specified array([[[1, 1, 1, 1],         [1, 1, 1, 1],         [1, 1, 1, 1]],         [[1, 1, 1, 1],         [1, 1, 1, 1],         [1, 1, 1, 1]]], dtype=int16) >>> np.empty( (2,3) )                                 # uninitialized array([[  3.73603959e-262,   6.02658058e-154,   6.55490914e-260],  # may vary        [  5.30498948e-313,   3.14673309e-307,   1.00000000e+000]]) To create sequences of numbers, NumPy provides the arange function which is analogous to the Python built-in range, but returns an array.  >>> >>> np.arange( 10, 30, 5 ) array([10, 15, 20, 25]) >>> np.arange( 0, 2, 0.3 )                 # it accepts float arguments array([0. , 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8]) When arange is used with floating point arguments, it is generally not possible to predict the number of elements obtained, due to the finite floating point precision. For this reason, it is usually better to use the function linspace that receives as an argument the number of elements that we want, instead of the step:  >>> >>> from numpy import pi >>> np.linspace( 0, 2, 9 )                 # 9 numbers from 0 to 2 array([0.  , 0.25, 0.5 , 0.75, 1.  , 1.25, 1.5 , 1.75, 2.  ]) >>> x = np.linspace( 0, 2*pi, 100 )        # useful to evaluate function at lots of points >>> f = np.sin(x) See also array, zeros, zeros_like, ones, ones_like, empty, empty_like, arange, linspace, numpy.random.Generator.rand, numpy.random.Generator.randn, fromfunction, fromfile  Printing Arrays When you print an array, NumPy displays it in a similar way to nested lists, but with the following layout:  the last axis is printed from left to right,  the second-to-last is printed from top to bottom,  the rest are also printed from top to bottom, with each slice separated from the next by an empty line.  One-dimensional arrays are then printed as rows, bidimensionals as matrices and tridimensionals as lists of matrices.  >>> >>> a = np.arange(6)                         # 1d array >>> print(a) [0 1 2 3 4 5] >>> >>> b = np.arange(12).reshape(4,3)           # 2d array >>> print(b) [[ 0  1  2]  [ 3  4  5]  [ 6  7  8]  [ 9 10 11]] >>> >>> c = np.arange(24).reshape(2,3,4)         # 3d array >>> print(c) [[[ 0  1  2  3]   [ 4  5  6  7]   [ 8  9 10 11]]   [[12 13 14 15]   [16 17 18 19]   [20 21 22 23]]] See below to get more details on reshape.  If an array is too large to be printed, NumPy automatically skips the central part of the array and only prints the corners:  >>> >>> print(np.arange(10000)) [   0    1    2 ... 9997 9998 9999] >>> >>> print(np.arange(10000).reshape(100,100)) [[   0    1    2 ...   97   98   99]  [ 100  101  102 ...  197  198  199]  [ 200  201  202 ...  297  298  299]  ...  [9700 9701 9702 ... 9797 9798 9799]  [9800 9801 9802 ... 9897 9898 9899]  [9900 9901 9902 ... 9997 9998 9999]] To disable this behaviour and force NumPy to print the entire array, you can change the printing options using set_printoptions.  >>> >>> np.set_printoptions(threshold=sys.maxsize)       # sys module should be imported Basic Operations Arithmetic operators on arrays apply elementwise. A new array is created and filled with the result.  >>> >>> a = np.array( [20,30,40,50] ) >>> b = np.arange( 4 ) >>> b array([0, 1, 2, 3]) >>> c = a-b >>> c array([20, 29, 38, 47]) >>> b**2 array([0, 1, 4, 9]) >>> 10*np.sin(a) array([ 9.12945251, -9.88031624,  7.4511316 , -2.62374854]) >>> a<35 array([ True,  True, False, False]) Unlike in many matrix languages, the product operator * operates elementwise in NumPy arrays. The matrix product can be performed using the @ operator (in python >=3.5) or the dot function or method:  >>> >>> A = np.array( [[1,1], ...                [0,1]] ) >>> B = np.array( [[2,0], ...                [3,4]] ) >>> A * B                       # elementwise product array([[2, 0],        [0, 4]]) >>> A @ B                       # matrix product array([[5, 4],        [3, 4]]) >>> A.dot(B)                    # another matrix product array([[5, 4],        [3, 4]]) Some operations, such as += and *=, act in place to modify an existing array rather than create a new one.  >>> >>> rg = np.random.default_rng(1)     # create instance of default random number generator >>> a = np.ones((2,3), dtype=int) >>> b = rg.random((2,3)) >>> a *= 3 >>> a array([[3, 3, 3],        [3, 3, 3]]) >>> b += a >>> b array([[3.51182162, 3.9504637 , 3.14415961],        [3.94864945, 3.31183145, 3.42332645]]) >>> a += b                            # b is not automatically converted to integer type Traceback (most recent call last):     ... numpy.core._exceptions.UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'add' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') with casting rule 'same_kind' When operating with arrays of different types, the type of the resulting array corresponds to the more general or precise one (a behavior known as upcasting).  >>> >>> a = np.ones(3, dtype=np.int32) >>> b = np.linspace(0,pi,3) >>> b.dtype.name 'float64' >>> c = a+b >>> c array([1.        , 2.57079633, 4.14159265]) >>> c.dtype.name 'float64' >>> d = np.exp(c*1j) >>> d array([ 0.54030231+0.84147098j, -0.84147098+0.54030231j,        -0.54030231-0.84147098j]) >>> d.dtype.name 'complex128' Many unary operations, such as computing the sum of all the elements in the array, are implemented as methods of the ndarray class.  >>> >>> a = rg.random((2,3)) >>> a array([[0.82770259, 0.40919914, 0.54959369],        [0.02755911, 0.75351311, 0.53814331]]) >>> a.sum() 3.1057109529998157 >>> a.min() 0.027559113243068367 >>> a.max() 0.8277025938204418 By default, these operations apply to the array as though it were a list of numbers, regardless of its shape. However, by specifying the axis parameter you can apply an operation along the specified axis of an array:  >>> >>> b = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4) >>> b array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],        [ 4,  5,  6,  7],        [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]) >>> >>> b.sum(axis=0)                            # sum of each column array([12, 15, 18, 21]) >>> >>> b.min(axis=1)                            # min of each row array([0, 4, 8]) >>> >>> b.cumsum(axis=1)                         # cumulative sum along each row array([[ 0,  1,  3,  6],        [ 4,  9, 15, 22],        [ 8, 17, 27, 38]]) Universal Functions NumPy provides familiar mathematical functions such as sin, cos, and exp. In NumPy, these are called “universal functions”(ufunc). Within NumPy, these functions operate elementwise on an array, producing an array as output.  >>> >>> B = np.arange(3) >>> B array([0, 1, 2]) >>> np.exp(B) array([1.        , 2.71828183, 7.3890561 ]) >>> np.sqrt(B) array([0.        , 1.        , 1.41421356]) >>> C = np.array([2., -1., 4.]) >>> np.add(B, C) array([2., 0., 6.]) See also all, any, apply_along_axis, argmax, argmin, argsort, average, bincount, ceil, clip, conj, corrcoef, cov, cross, cumprod, cumsum, diff, dot, floor, inner, invert, lexsort, max, maximum, mean, median, min, minimum, nonzero, outer, prod, re, round, sort, std, sum, trace, transpose, var, vdot, vectorize, where  Indexing, Slicing and Iterating One-dimensional arrays can be indexed, sliced and iterated over, much like lists and other Python sequences.  >>> >>> a = np.arange(10)**3 >>> a array([  0,   1,   8,  27,  64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729]) >>> a[2] 8 >>> a[2:5] array([ 8, 27, 64]) # equivalent to a[0:6:2] = 1000; # from start to position 6, exclusive, set every 2nd element to 1000 >>> a[:6:2] = 1000 >>> a array([1000,    1, 1000,   27, 1000,  125,  216,  343,  512,  729]) >>> a[ : :-1]                                 # reversed a array([ 729,  512,  343,  216,  125, 1000,   27, 1000,    1, 1000]) >>> for i in a: ...     print(i**(1/3.)) ... 9.999999999999998 1.0 9.999999999999998 3.0 9.999999999999998 4.999999999999999 5.999999999999999 6.999999999999999 7.999999999999999 8.999999999999998 Multidimensional arrays can have one index per axis. These indices are given in a tuple separated by commas:  >>> >>> def f(x,y): ...     return 10*x+y ... >>> b = np.fromfunction(f,(5,4),dtype=int) >>> b array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],        [10, 11, 12, 13],        [20, 21, 22, 23],        [30, 31, 32, 33],        [40, 41, 42, 43]]) >>> b[2,3] 23 >>> b[0:5, 1]                       # each row in the second column of b array([ 1, 11, 21, 31, 41]) >>> b[ : ,1]                        # equivalent to the previous example array([ 1, 11, 21, 31, 41]) >>> b[1:3, : ]                      # each column in the second and third row of b array([[10, 11, 12, 13],        [20, 21, 22, 23]]) When fewer indices are provided than the number of axes, the missing indices are considered complete slices:  >>> >>> b[-1]                                  # the last row. Equivalent to b[-1,:] array([40, 41, 42, 43]) The expression within brackets in b[i] is treated as an i followed by as many instances of : as needed to represent the remaining axes. NumPy also allows you to write this using dots as b[i,...].  The dots (...) represent as many colons as needed to produce a complete indexing tuple. For example, if x is an array with 5 axes, then  x[1,2,...] is equivalent to x[1,2,:,:,:],  x[...,3] to x[:,:,:,:,3] and  x[4,...,5,:] to x[4,:,:,5,:].  >>> >>> c = np.array( [[[  0,  1,  2],               # a 3D array (two stacked 2D arrays) ...                 [ 10, 12, 13]], ...                [[100,101,102], ...                 [110,112,113]]]) >>> c.shape (2, 2, 3) >>> c[1,...]                                   # same as c[1,:,:] or c[1] array([[100, 101, 102],        [110, 112, 113]]) >>> c[...,2]                                   # same as c[:,:,2] array([[  2,  13],        [102, 113]]) Iterating over multidimensional arrays is done with respect to the first axis:  >>> >>> for row in b: ...     print(row) ... [0 1 2 3] [10 11 12 13] [20 21 22 23] [30 31 32 33] [40 41 42 43] However, if one wants to perform an operation on each element in the array, one can use the flat attribute which is an iterator over all the elements of the array:  >>> >>> for element in b.flat: ...     print(element) ... 0 1 2 3 10 11 12 13 20 21 22 23 30 31 32 33 40 41 42 43 See also Indexing, Indexing (reference), newaxis, ndenumerate, indices  Shape Manipulation Changing the shape of an array An array has a shape given by the number of elements along each axis:  >>> >>> a = np.floor(10*rg.random((3,4))) >>> a array([[3., 7., 3., 4.],        [1., 4., 2., 2.],        [7., 2., 4., 9.]]) >>> a.shape (3, 4) The shape of an array can be changed with various commands. Note that the following three commands all return a modified array, but do not change the original array:  >>> >>> a.ravel()  # returns the array, flattened array([3., 7., 3., 4., 1., 4., 2., 2., 7., 2., 4., 9.]) >>> a.reshape(6,2)  # returns the array with a modified shape array([[3., 7.],        [3., 4.],        [1., 4.],        [2., 2.],        [7., 2.],        [4., 9.]]) >>> a.T  # returns the array, transposed array([[3., 1., 7.],        [7., 4., 2.],        [3., 2., 4.],        [4., 2., 9.]]) >>> a.T.shape (4, 3) >>> a.shape (3, 4) The order of the elements in the array resulting from ravel() is normally “C-style”, that is, the rightmost index “changes the fastest”, so the element after a[0,0] is a[0,1]. If the array is reshaped to some other shape, again the array is treated as “C-style”. NumPy normally creates arrays stored in this order, so ravel() will usually not need to copy its argument, but if the array was made by taking slices of another array or created with unusual options, it may need to be copied. The functions ravel() and reshape() can also be instructed, using an optional argument, to use FORTRAN-style arrays, in which the leftmost index changes the fastest.  The reshape function returns its argument with a modified shape, whereas the ndarray.resize method modifies the array itself:  >>> >>> a array([[3., 7., 3., 4.],        [1., 4., 2., 2.],        [7., 2., 4., 9.]]) >>> a.resize((2,6)) >>> a array([[3., 7., 3., 4., 1., 4.],        [2., 2., 7., 2., 4., 9.]]) If a dimension is given as -1 in a reshaping operation, the other dimensions are automatically calculated:  >>> >>> a.reshape(3,-1) array([[3., 7., 3., 4.],        [1., 4., 2., 2.],        [7., 2., 4., 9.]]) See also ndarray.shape, reshape, resize, ravel  Stacking together different arrays Several arrays can be stacked together along different axes:  >>> >>> a = np.floor(10*rg.random((2,2))) >>> a array([[9., 7.],        [5., 2.]]) >>> b = np.floor(10*rg.random((2,2))) >>> b array([[1., 9.],        [5., 1.]]) >>> np.vstack((a,b)) array([[9., 7.],        [5., 2.],        [1., 9.],        [5., 1.]]) >>> np.hstack((a,b)) array([[9., 7., 1., 9.],        [5., 2., 5., 1.]]) The function column_stack stacks 1D arrays as columns into a 2D array. It is equivalent to hstack only for 2D arrays:  >>> >>> from numpy import newaxis >>> np.column_stack((a,b))     # with 2D arrays array([[9., 7., 1., 9.],        [5., 2., 5., 1.]]) >>> a = np.array([4.,2.]) >>> b = np.array([3.,8.]) >>> np.column_stack((a,b))     # returns a 2D array array([[4., 3.],        [2., 8.]]) >>> np.hstack((a,b))           # the result is different array([4., 2., 3., 8.]) >>> a[:,newaxis]               # view `a` as a 2D column vector array([[4.],        [2.]]) >>> np.column_stack((a[:,newaxis],b[:,newaxis])) array([[4., 3.],        [2., 8.]]) >>> np.hstack((a[:,newaxis],b[:,newaxis]))   # the result is the same array([[4., 3.],        [2., 8.]]) On the other hand, the function row_stack is equivalent to vstack for any input arrays. In fact, row_stack is an alias for vstack:  >>> >>> np.column_stack is np.hstack False >>> np.row_stack is np.vstack True In general, for arrays with more than two dimensions, hstack stacks along their second axes, vstack stacks along their first axes, and concatenate allows for an optional arguments giving the number of the axis along which the concatenation should happen.  Note  In complex cases, r_ and c_ are useful for creating arrays by stacking numbers along one axis. They allow the use of range literals (“:”)  >>> >>> np.r_[1:4,0,4] array([1, 2, 3, 0, 4]) When used with arrays as arguments, r_ and c_ are similar to vstack and hstack in their default behavior, but allow for an optional argument giving the number of the axis along which to concatenate.  See also hstack, vstack, column_stack, concatenate, c_, r_  Splitting one array into several smaller ones Using hsplit, you can split an array along its horizontal axis, either by specifying the number of equally shaped arrays to return, or by specifying the columns after which the division should occur:  >>> >>> a = np.floor(10*rg.random((2,12))) >>> a array([[6., 7., 6., 9., 0., 5., 4., 0., 6., 8., 5., 2.],        [8., 5., 5., 7., 1., 8., 6., 7., 1., 8., 1., 0.]]) # Split a into 3 >>> np.hsplit(a,3) [array([[6., 7., 6., 9.],        [8., 5., 5., 7.]]), array([[0., 5., 4., 0.],        [1., 8., 6., 7.]]), array([[6., 8., 5., 2.],        [1., 8., 1., 0.]])] # Split a after the third and the fourth column >>> np.hsplit(a,(3,4)) [array([[6., 7., 6.],        [8., 5., 5.]]), array([[9.],        [7.]]), array([[0., 5., 4., 0., 6., 8., 5., 2.],        [1., 8., 6., 7., 1., 8., 1., 0.]])] vsplit splits along the vertical axis, and array_split allows one to specify along which axis to split.  Copies and Views When operating and manipulating arrays, their data is sometimes copied into a new array and sometimes not. This is often a source of confusion for beginners. There are three cases:  No Copy at All Simple assignments make no copy of objects or their data.  >>> >>> a = np.array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3], ...               [ 4,  5,  6,  7], ...               [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]) >>> b = a            # no new object is created >>> b is a           # a and b are two names for the same ndarray object True Python passes mutable objects as references, so function calls make no copy.  >>> >>> def f(x): ...     print(id(x)) ... >>> id(a)                           # id is a unique identifier of an object 148293216  # may vary >>> f(a) 148293216  # may vary View or Shallow Copy Different array objects can share the same data. The view method creates a new array object that looks at the same data.  >>> >>> c = a.view() >>> c is a False >>> c.base is a                        # c is a view of the data owned by a True >>> c.flags.owndata False >>> >>> c = c.reshape((2, 6))                      # a's shape doesn't change >>> a.shape (3, 4) >>> c[0, 4] = 1234                      # a's data changes >>> a array([[   0,    1,    2,    3],        [1234,    5,    6,    7],        [   8,    9,   10,   11]]) Slicing an array returns a view of it:  >>> >>> s = a[ : , 1:3]     # spaces added for clarity; could also be written \"s = a[:, 1:3]\" >>> s[:] = 10           # s[:] is a view of s. Note the difference between s = 10 and s[:] = 10 >>> a array([[   0,   10,   10,    3],        [1234,   10,   10,    7],        [   8,   10,   10,   11]]) Deep Copy The copy method makes a complete copy of the array and its data.  >>> >>> d = a.copy()                          # a new array object with new data is created >>> d is a False >>> d.base is a                           # d doesn't share anything with a False >>> d[0,0] = 9999 >>> a array([[   0,   10,   10,    3],        [1234,   10,   10,    7],        [   8,   10,   10,   11]]) Sometimes copy should be called after slicing if the original array is not required anymore. For example, suppose a is a huge intermediate result and the final result b only contains a small fraction of a, a deep copy should be made when constructing b with slicing:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(int(1e8)) >>> b = a[:100].copy() >>> del a  # the memory of ``a`` can be released. If b = a[:100] is used instead, a is referenced by b and will persist in memory even if del a is executed.

The first rule of broadcasting is that if all input arrays do not have the same number of dimensions, a “1” will be repeatedly prepended to the shapes of the smaller arrays until all the arrays have the same number of dimensions.  The second rule of broadcasting ensures that arrays with a size of 1 along a particular dimension act as if they had the size of the array with the largest shape along that dimension. The value of the array element is assumed to be the same along that dimension for the “broadcast” array.  After application of the broadcasting rules, the sizes of all arrays must match. More details can be found in Broadcasting.  Advanced indexing and index tricks NumPy offers more indexing facilities than regular Python sequences. In addition to indexing by integers and slices, as we saw before, arrays can be indexed by arrays of integers and arrays of booleans.  Indexing with Arrays of Indices >>> >>> a = np.arange(12)**2                       # the first 12 square numbers >>> i = np.array([1, 1, 3, 8, 5])              # an array of indices >>> a[i]                                       # the elements of a at the positions i array([ 1,  1,  9, 64, 25]) >>> >>> j = np.array([[3, 4], [9, 7]])      # a bidimensional array of indices >>> a[j]                                       # the same shape as j array([[ 9, 16],        [81, 49]]) When the indexed array a is multidimensional, a single array of indices refers to the first dimension of a. The following example shows this behavior by converting an image of labels into a color image using a palette.  >>> >>> palette = np.array([[0, 0, 0],         # black ...                     [255, 0, 0],       # red ...                     [0, 255, 0],       # green ...                     [0, 0, 255],       # blue ...                     [255, 255, 255]])  # white >>> image = np.array([[0, 1, 2, 0],        # each value corresponds to a color in the palette ...                   [0, 3, 4, 0]]) >>> palette[image]                         # the (2, 4, 3) color image array([[[  0,   0,   0],         [255,   0,   0],         [  0, 255,   0],         [  0,   0,   0]],         [[  0,   0,   0],         [  0,   0, 255],         [255, 255, 255],         [  0,   0,   0]]]) We can also give indexes for more than one dimension. The arrays of indices for each dimension must have the same shape.  >>> >>> a = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4) >>> a array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],        [ 4,  5,  6,  7],        [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]) >>> i = np.array([[0, 1],                     # indices for the first dim of a ...               [1, 2]]) >>> j = np.array([[2, 1],                     # indices for the second dim ...               [3, 3]]) >>> >>> a[i, j]                                   # i and j must have equal shape array([[ 2,  5],        [ 7, 11]]) >>> >>> a[i, 2] array([[ 2,  6],        [ 6, 10]]) >>> >>> a[:, j]                                     # i.e., a[ : , j] array([[[ 2,  1],         [ 3,  3]],         [[ 6,  5],         [ 7,  7]],         [[10,  9],         [11, 11]]]) In Python, arr[i, j] is exactly the same as arr[(i, j)]—so we can put i and j in a tuple and then do the indexing with that.  >>> >>> l = (i, j) # equivalent to a[i, j] >>> a[l] array([[ 2,  5],        [ 7, 11]]) However, we can not do this by putting i and j into an array, because this array will be interpreted as indexing the first dimension of a.  >>> >>> s = np.array([i, j])  # not what we want >>> a[s] Traceback (most recent call last):   File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module> IndexError: index 3 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 3  # same as a[i, j] >>> a[tuple(s)] array([[ 2,  5],        [ 7, 11]]) Another common use of indexing with arrays is the search of the maximum value of time-dependent series:  >>> >>> time = np.linspace(20, 145, 5)                 # time scale >>> data = np.sin(np.arange(20)).reshape(5,4)      # 4 time-dependent series >>> time array([ 20.  ,  51.25,  82.5 , 113.75, 145.  ]) >>> data array([[ 0.        ,  0.84147098,  0.90929743,  0.14112001],        [-0.7568025 , -0.95892427, -0.2794155 ,  0.6569866 ],        [ 0.98935825,  0.41211849, -0.54402111, -0.99999021],        [-0.53657292,  0.42016704,  0.99060736,  0.65028784],        [-0.28790332, -0.96139749, -0.75098725,  0.14987721]])  # index of the maxima for each series >>> ind = data.argmax(axis=0) >>> ind array([2, 0, 3, 1])  # times corresponding to the maxima >>> time_max = time[ind] >>> >>> data_max = data[ind, range(data.shape[1])] # => data[ind[0],0], data[ind[1],1]...  >>> time_max array([ 82.5 ,  20.  , 113.75,  51.25]) >>> data_max array([0.98935825, 0.84147098, 0.99060736, 0.6569866 ])  >>> np.all(data_max == data.max(axis=0)) True You can also use indexing with arrays as a target to assign to:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(5) >>> a array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) >>> a[[1,3,4]] = 0 >>> a array([0, 0, 2, 0, 0]) However, when the list of indices contains repetitions, the assignment is done several times, leaving behind the last value:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(5) >>> a[[0,0,2]]=[1,2,3] >>> a array([2, 1, 3, 3, 4]) This is reasonable enough, but watch out if you want to use Python’s += construct, as it may not do what you expect:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(5) >>> a[[0,0,2]]+=1 >>> a array([1, 1, 3, 3, 4]) Even though 0 occurs twice in the list of indices, the 0th element is only incremented once. This is because Python requires “a+=1” to be equivalent to “a = a + 1”.  Indexing with Boolean Arrays When we index arrays with arrays of (integer) indices we are providing the list of indices to pick. With boolean indices the approach is different; we explicitly choose which items in the array we want and which ones we don’t.  The most natural way one can think of for boolean indexing is to use boolean arrays that have the same shape as the original array:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4) >>> b = a > 4 >>> b                                          # b is a boolean with a's shape array([[False, False, False, False],        [False,  True,  True,  True],        [ True,  True,  True,  True]]) >>> a[b]                                       # 1d array with the selected elements array([ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11]) This property can be very useful in assignments:  >>> >>> a[b] = 0                                   # All elements of 'a' higher than 4 become 0 >>> a array([[0, 1, 2, 3],        [4, 0, 0, 0],        [0, 0, 0, 0]]) You can look at the following example to see how to use boolean indexing to generate an image of the Mandelbrot set:  >>> import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def mandelbrot( h,w, maxit=20 ):     \"\"\"Returns an image of the Mandelbrot fractal of size (h,w).\"\"\"     y,x = np.ogrid[ -1.4:1.4:h*1j, -2:0.8:w*1j ]     c = x+y*1j     z = c     divtime = maxit + np.zeros(z.shape, dtype=int)      for i in range(maxit):         z = z**2 + c         diverge = z*np.conj(z) > 2**2            # who is diverging         div_now = diverge & (divtime==maxit)  # who is diverging now         divtime[div_now] = i                  # note when         z[diverge] = 2                        # avoid diverging too much      return divtime plt.imshow(mandelbrot(400,400)) ../_images/quickstart-1.png The second way of indexing with booleans is more similar to integer indexing; for each dimension of the array we give a 1D boolean array selecting the slices we want:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4) >>> b1 = np.array([False,True,True])             # first dim selection >>> b2 = np.array([True,False,True,False])       # second dim selection >>> >>> a[b1,:]                                   # selecting rows array([[ 4,  5,  6,  7],        [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]) >>> >>> a[b1]                                     # same thing array([[ 4,  5,  6,  7],        [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]) >>> >>> a[:,b2]                                   # selecting columns array([[ 0,  2],        [ 4,  6],        [ 8, 10]]) >>> >>> a[b1,b2]                                  # a weird thing to do array([ 4, 10]) Note that the length of the 1D boolean array must coincide with the length of the dimension (or axis) you want to slice. In the previous example, b1 has length 3 (the number of rows in a), and b2 (of length 4) is suitable to index the 2nd axis (columns) of a.  The ix_() function The ix_ function can be used to combine different vectors so as to obtain the result for each n-uplet. For example, if you want to compute all the a+b*c for all the triplets taken from each of the vectors a, b and c:  >>> >>> a = np.array([2,3,4,5]) >>> b = np.array([8,5,4]) >>> c = np.array([5,4,6,8,3]) >>> ax,bx,cx = np.ix_(a,b,c) >>> ax array([[[2]],         [[3]],         [[4]],         [[5]]]) >>> bx array([[[8],         [5],         [4]]]) >>> cx array([[[5, 4, 6, 8, 3]]]) >>> ax.shape, bx.shape, cx.shape ((4, 1, 1), (1, 3, 1), (1, 1, 5)) >>> result = ax+bx*cx >>> result array([[[42, 34, 50, 66, 26],         [27, 22, 32, 42, 17],         [22, 18, 26, 34, 14]],         [[43, 35, 51, 67, 27],         [28, 23, 33, 43, 18],         [23, 19, 27, 35, 15]],         [[44, 36, 52, 68, 28],         [29, 24, 34, 44, 19],         [24, 20, 28, 36, 16]],         [[45, 37, 53, 69, 29],         [30, 25, 35, 45, 20],         [25, 21, 29, 37, 17]]]) >>> result[3,2,4] 17 >>> a[3]+b[2]*c[4] 17 You could also implement the reduce as follows:  >>> >>> def ufunc_reduce(ufct, *vectors): ...    vs = np.ix_(*vectors) ...    r = ufct.identity ...    for v in vs: ...        r = ufct(r,v) ...    return r and then use it as:  >>> >>> ufunc_reduce(np.add,a,b,c) array([[[15, 14, 16, 18, 13],         [12, 11, 13, 15, 10],         [11, 10, 12, 14,  9]],         [[16, 15, 17, 19, 14],         [13, 12, 14, 16, 11],         [12, 11, 13, 15, 10]],         [[17, 16, 18, 20, 15],         [14, 13, 15, 17, 12],         [13, 12, 14, 16, 11]],         [[18, 17, 19, 21, 16],         [15, 14, 16, 18, 13],         [14, 13, 15, 17, 12]]]) The advantage of this version of reduce compared to the normal ufunc.reduce is that it makes use of the Broadcasting Rules in order to avoid creating an argument array the size of the output times the number of vectors.

The normalized (unit \"length\") eigenvectors, such that the     column ``v[:,i]`` is the eigenvector corresponding to the     eigenvalue ``w[i]`` . Tricks and Tips Here we give a list of short and useful tips.  “Automatic” Reshaping To change the dimensions of an array, you can omit one of the sizes which will then be deduced automatically:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(30) >>> b = a.reshape((2, -1, 3))  # -1 means \"whatever is needed\" >>> b.shape (2, 5, 3) >>> b array([[[ 0,  1,  2],         [ 3,  4,  5],         [ 6,  7,  8],         [ 9, 10, 11],         [12, 13, 14]],         [[15, 16, 17],         [18, 19, 20],         [21, 22, 23],         [24, 25, 26],         [27, 28, 29]]]) Vector Stacking How do we construct a 2D array from a list of equally-sized row vectors? In MATLAB this is quite easy: if x and y are two vectors of the same length you only need do m=[x;y]. In NumPy this works via the functions column_stack, dstack, hstack and vstack, depending on the dimension in which the stacking is to be done. For example:  >>> >>> x = np.arange(0,10,2) >>> y = np.arange(5) >>> m = np.vstack([x,y]) >>> m array([[0, 2, 4, 6, 8],        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]]) >>> xy = np.hstack([x,y]) >>> xy array([0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) The logic behind those functions in more than two dimensions can be strange.  See also NumPy for Matlab users  Histograms The NumPy histogram function applied to an array returns a pair of vectors: the histogram of the array and a vector of the bin edges. Beware: matplotlib also has a function to build histograms (called hist, as in Matlab) that differs from the one in NumPy. The main difference is that pylab.hist plots the histogram automatically, while numpy.histogram only generates the data.  >>> import numpy as np rg = np.random.default_rng(1) import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Build a vector of 10000 normal deviates with variance 0.5^2 and mean 2 mu, sigma = 2, 0.5 v = rg.normal(mu,sigma,10000) # Plot a normalized histogram with 50 bins plt.hist(v, bins=50, density=1)       # matplotlib version (plot) # Compute the histogram with numpy and then plot it (n, bins) = np.histogram(v, bins=50, density=True)  # NumPy version (no plot) plt.plot(.5*(bins[1:]+bins[:-1]), n) ../_images/quickstart-2.png Further reading The Python tutorial  NumPy Reference  SciPy Tutorial  SciPy Lecture Notes  A matlab, R, IDL, NumPy/SciPy dictionary  © Copyright 2008-2020, The SciPy community.

    "content": "Quickstart tutorial Prerequisites Before reading this tutorial you should know a bit of Python. If you would like to refresh your memory, take a look at the Python tutorial.  If you wish to work the examples in this tutorial, you must also have some software installed on your computer. Please see https://scipy.org/install.html for instructions.  Learner profile  This tutorial is intended as a quick overview of algebra and arrays in NumPy and want to understand how n-dimensional (n>=2) arrays are represented and can be manipulated. In particular, if you don’t know how to apply common functions to n-dimensional arrays (without using for-loops), or if you want to understand axis and shape properties for n-dimensional arrays, this tutorial might be of help.  Learning Objectives  After this tutorial, you should be able to:  Understand the difference between one-, two- and n-dimensional arrays in NumPy;  Understand how to apply some linear algebra operations to n-dimensional arrays without using for-loops;  Understand axis and shape properties for n-dimensional arrays.  The Basics NumPy’s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. In NumPy dimensions are called axes.  For example, the coordinates of a point in 3D space [1, 2, 1] has one axis. That axis has 3 elements in it, so we say it has a length of 3. In the example pictured below, the array has 2 axes. The first axis has a length of 2, the second axis has a length of 3.  [[ 1., 0., 0.],  [ 0., 1., 2.]] NumPy’s array class is called ndarray. It is also known by the alias array. Note that numpy.array is not the same as the Standard Python Library class array.array, which only handles one-dimensional arrays and offers less functionality. The more important attributes of an ndarray object are:  ndarray.ndim the number of axes (dimensions) of the array.  ndarray.shape the dimensions of the array. This is a tuple of integers indicating the size of the array in each dimension. For a matrix with n rows and m columns, shape will be (n,m). The length of the shape tuple is therefore the number of axes, ndim.  ndarray.size the total number of elements of the array. This is equal to the product of the elements of shape.  ndarray.dtype an object describing the type of the elements in the array. One can create or specify dtype’s using standard Python types. Additionally NumPy provides types of its own. numpy.int32, numpy.int16, and numpy.float64 are some examples.  ndarray.itemsize the size in bytes of each element of the array. For example, an array of elements of type float64 has itemsize 8 (=64/8), while one of type complex32 has itemsize 4 (=32/8). It is equivalent to ndarray.dtype.itemsize.  ndarray.data the buffer containing the actual elements of the array. Normally, we won’t need to use this attribute because we will access the elements in an array using indexing facilities.  An example >>> import numpy as np a = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5) a array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],        [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9],        [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]]) a.shape (3, 5) a.ndim 2 a.dtype.name 'int64' a.itemsize 8 a.size 15 type(a) <class 'numpy.ndarray'> b = np.array([6, 7, 8]) b array([6, 7, 8]) type(b) <class 'numpy.ndarray'> Array Creation There are several ways to create arrays.  For example, you can create an array from a regular Python list or tuple using the array function. The type of the resulting array is deduced from the type of the elements in the sequences.  >>> >>> import numpy as np >>> a = np.array([2,3,4]) >>> a array([2, 3, 4]) >>> a.dtype dtype('int64') >>> b = np.array([1.2, 3.5, 5.1]) >>> b.dtype dtype('float64') A frequent error consists in calling array with multiple arguments, rather than providing a single sequence as an argument.  >>> >>> a = np.array(1,2,3,4)    # WRONG Traceback (most recent call last):   ... TypeError: array() takes from 1 to 2 positional arguments but 4 were given >>> a = np.array([1,2,3,4])  # RIGHT array transforms sequences of sequences into two-dimensional arrays, sequences of sequences of sequences into three-dimensional arrays, and so on.  >>> >>> b = np.array([(1.5,2,3), (4,5,6)]) >>> b array([[1.5, 2. , 3. ],        [4. , 5. , 6. ]]) The type of the array can also be explicitly specified at creation time:  >>> >>> c = np.array( [ [1,2], [3,4] ], dtype=complex ) >>> c array([[1.+0.j, 2.+0.j],        [3.+0.j, 4.+0.j]]) Often, the elements of an array are originally unknown, but its size is known. Hence, NumPy offers several functions to create arrays with initial placeholder content. These minimize the necessity of growing arrays, an expensive operation.  The function zeros creates an array full of zeros, the function ones creates an array full of ones, and the function empty creates an array whose initial content is random and depends on the state of the memory. By default, the dtype of the created array is float64.  >>> >>> np.zeros((3, 4)) array([[0., 0., 0., 0.],        [0., 0., 0., 0.],        [0., 0., 0., 0.]]) >>> np.ones( (2,3,4), dtype=np.int16 )                # dtype can also be specified array([[[1, 1, 1, 1],         [1, 1, 1, 1],         [1, 1, 1, 1]],         [[1, 1, 1, 1],         [1, 1, 1, 1],         [1, 1, 1, 1]]], dtype=int16) >>> np.empty( (2,3) )                                 # uninitialized array([[  3.73603959e-262,   6.02658058e-154,   6.55490914e-260],  # may vary        [  5.30498948e-313,   3.14673309e-307,   1.00000000e+000]]) To create sequences of numbers, NumPy provides the arange function which is analogous to the Python built-in range, but returns an array.  >>> >>> np.arange( 10, 30, 5 ) array([10, 15, 20, 25]) >>> np.arange( 0, 2, 0.3 )                 # it accepts float arguments array([0. , 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8]) When arange is used with floating point arguments, it is generally not possible to predict the number of elements obtained, due to the finite floating point precision. For this reason, it is usually better to use the function linspace that receives as an argument the number of elements that we want, instead of the step:  >>> >>> from numpy import pi >>> np.linspace( 0, 2, 9 )                 # 9 numbers from 0 to 2 array([0.  , 0.25, 0.5 , 0.75, 1.  , 1.25, 1.5 , 1.75, 2.  ]) >>> x = np.linspace( 0, 2*pi, 100 )        # useful to evaluate function at lots of points >>> f = np.sin(x) See also array, zeros, zeros_like, ones, ones_like, empty, empty_like, arange, linspace, numpy.random.Generator.rand, numpy.random.Generator.randn, fromfunction, fromfile  Printing Arrays When you print an array, NumPy displays it in a similar way to nested lists, but with the following layout:  the last axis is printed from left to right,  the second-to-last is printed from top to bottom,  the rest are also printed from top to bottom, with each slice separated from the next by an empty line.  One-dimensional arrays are then printed as rows, bidimensionals as matrices and tridimensionals as lists of matrices.  >>> >>> a = np.arange(6)                         # 1d array >>> print(a) [0 1 2 3 4 5] >>> >>> b = np.arange(12).reshape(4,3)           # 2d array >>> print(b) [[ 0  1  2]  [ 3  4  5]  [ 6  7  8]  [ 9 10 11]] >>> >>> c = np.arange(24).reshape(2,3,4)         # 3d array >>> print(c) [[[ 0  1  2  3]   [ 4  5  6  7]   [ 8  9 10 11]]   [[12 13 14 15]   [16 17 18 19]   [20 21 22 23]]] See below to get more details on reshape.  If an array is too large to be printed, NumPy automatically skips the central part of the array and only prints the corners:  >>> >>> print(np.arange(10000)) [   0    1    2 ... 9997 9998 9999] >>> >>> print(np.arange(10000).reshape(100,100)) [[   0    1    2 ...   97   98   99]  [ 100  101  102 ...  197  198  199]  [ 200  201  202 ...  297  298  299]  ...  [9700 9701 9702 ... 9797 9798 9799]  [9800 9801 9802 ... 9897 9898 9899]  [9900 9901 9902 ... 9997 9998 9999]] To disable this behaviour and force NumPy to print the entire array, you can change the printing options using set_printoptions.  >>> >>> np.set_printoptions(threshold=sys.maxsize)       # sys module should be imported Basic Operations Arithmetic operators on arrays apply elementwise. A new array is created and filled with the result.  >>> >>> a = np.array( [20,30,40,50] ) >>> b = np.arange( 4 ) >>> b array([0, 1, 2, 3]) >>> c = a-b >>> c array([20, 29, 38, 47]) >>> b**2 array([0, 1, 4, 9]) >>> 10*np.sin(a) array([ 9.12945251, -9.88031624,  7.4511316 , -2.62374854]) >>> a<35 array([ True,  True, False, False]) Unlike in many matrix languages, the product operator * operates elementwise in NumPy arrays. The matrix product can be performed using the @ operator (in python >=3.5) or the dot function or method:  >>> >>> A = np.array( [[1,1], ...                [0,1]] ) >>> B = np.array( [[2,0], ...                [3,4]] ) >>> A * B                       # elementwise product array([[2, 0],        [0, 4]]) >>> A @ B                       # matrix product array([[5, 4],        [3, 4]]) >>> A.dot(B)                    # another matrix product array([[5, 4],        [3, 4]]) Some operations, such as += and *=, act in place to modify an existing array rather than create a new one.  >>> >>> rg = np.random.default_rng(1)     # create instance of default random number generator >>> a = np.ones((2,3), dtype=int) >>> b = rg.random((2,3)) >>> a *= 3 >>> a array([[3, 3, 3],        [3, 3, 3]]) >>> b += a >>> b array([[3.51182162, 3.9504637 , 3.14415961],        [3.94864945, 3.31183145, 3.42332645]]) >>> a += b                            # b is not automatically converted to integer type Traceback (most recent call last):     ... numpy.core._exceptions.UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'add' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') with casting rule 'same_kind' When operating with arrays of different types, the type of the resulting array corresponds to the more general or precise one (a behavior known as upcasting).  >>> >>> a = np.ones(3, dtype=np.int32) >>> b = np.linspace(0,pi,3) >>> b.dtype.name 'float64' >>> c = a+b >>> c array([1.        , 2.57079633, 4.14159265]) >>> c.dtype.name 'float64' >>> d = np.exp(c*1j) >>> d array([ 0.54030231+0.84147098j, -0.84147098+0.54030231j,        -0.54030231-0.84147098j]) >>> d.dtype.name 'complex128' Many unary operations, such as computing the sum of all the elements in the array, are implemented as methods of the ndarray class.  >>> >>> a = rg.random((2,3)) >>> a array([[0.82770259, 0.40919914, 0.54959369],        [0.02755911, 0.75351311, 0.53814331]]) >>> a.sum() 3.1057109529998157 >>> a.min() 0.027559113243068367 >>> a.max() 0.8277025938204418 By default, these operations apply to the array as though it were a list of numbers, regardless of its shape. However, by specifying the axis parameter you can apply an operation along the specified axis of an array:  >>> >>> b = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4) >>> b array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],        [ 4,  5,  6,  7],        [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]) >>> >>> b.sum(axis=0)                            # sum of each column array([12, 15, 18, 21]) >>> >>> b.min(axis=1)                            # min of each row array([0, 4, 8]) >>> >>> b.cumsum(axis=1)                         # cumulative sum along each row array([[ 0,  1,  3,  6],        [ 4,  9, 15, 22],        [ 8, 17, 27, 38]]) Universal Functions NumPy provides familiar mathematical functions such as sin, cos, and exp. In NumPy, these are called “universal functions”(ufunc). Within NumPy, these functions operate elementwise on an array, producing an array as output.  >>> >>> B = np.arange(3) >>> B array([0, 1, 2]) >>> np.exp(B) array([1.        , 2.71828183, 7.3890561 ]) >>> np.sqrt(B) array([0.        , 1.        , 1.41421356]) >>> C = np.array([2., -1., 4.]) >>> np.add(B, C) array([2., 0., 6.]) See also all, any, apply_along_axis, argmax, argmin, argsort, average, bincount, ceil, clip, conj, corrcoef, cov, cross, cumprod, cumsum, diff, dot, floor, inner, invert, lexsort, max, maximum, mean, median, min, minimum, nonzero, outer, prod, re, round, sort, std, sum, trace, transpose, var, vdot, vectorize, where  Indexing, Slicing and Iterating One-dimensional arrays can be indexed, sliced and iterated over, much like lists and other Python sequences.  >>> >>> a = np.arange(10)**3 >>> a array([  0,   1,   8,  27,  64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729]) >>> a[2] 8 >>> a[2:5] array([ 8, 27, 64]) # equivalent to a[0:6:2] = 1000; # from start to position 6, exclusive, set every 2nd element to 1000 >>> a[:6:2] = 1000 >>> a array([1000,    1, 1000,   27, 1000,  125,  216,  343,  512,  729]) >>> a[ : :-1]                                 # reversed a array([ 729,  512,  343,  216,  125, 1000,   27, 1000,    1, 1000]) >>> for i in a: ...     print(i**(1/3.)) ... 9.999999999999998 1.0 9.999999999999998 3.0 9.999999999999998 4.999999999999999 5.999999999999999 6.999999999999999 7.999999999999999 8.999999999999998 Multidimensional arrays can have one index per axis. These indices are given in a tuple separated by commas:  >>> >>> def f(x,y): ...     return 10*x+y ... >>> b = np.fromfunction(f,(5,4),dtype=int) >>> b array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],        [10, 11, 12, 13],        [20, 21, 22, 23],        [30, 31, 32, 33],        [40, 41, 42, 43]]) >>> b[2,3] 23 >>> b[0:5, 1]                       # each row in the second column of b array([ 1, 11, 21, 31, 41]) >>> b[ : ,1]                        # equivalent to the previous example array([ 1, 11, 21, 31, 41]) >>> b[1:3, : ]                      # each column in the second and third row of b array([[10, 11, 12, 13],        [20, 21, 22, 23]]) When fewer indices are provided than the number of axes, the missing indices are considered complete slices:  >>> >>> b[-1]                                  # the last row. Equivalent to b[-1,:] array([40, 41, 42, 43]) The expression within brackets in b[i] is treated as an i followed by as many instances of : as needed to represent the remaining axes. NumPy also allows you to write this using dots as b[i,...].  The dots (...) represent as many colons as needed to produce a complete indexing tuple. For example, if x is an array with 5 axes, then  x[1,2,...] is equivalent to x[1,2,:,:,:],  x[...,3] to x[:,:,:,:,3] and  x[4,...,5,:] to x[4,:,:,5,:].  >>> >>> c = np.array( [[[  0,  1,  2],               # a 3D array (two stacked 2D arrays) ...                 [ 10, 12, 13]], ...                [[100,101,102], ...                 [110,112,113]]]) >>> c.shape (2, 2, 3) >>> c[1,...]                                   # same as c[1,:,:] or c[1] array([[100, 101, 102],        [110, 112, 113]]) >>> c[...,2]                                   # same as c[:,:,2] array([[  2,  13],        [102, 113]]) Iterating over multidimensional arrays is done with respect to the first axis:  >>> >>> for row in b: ...     print(row) ... [0 1 2 3] [10 11 12 13] [20 21 22 23] [30 31 32 33] [40 41 42 43] However, if one wants to perform an operation on each element in the array, one can use the flat attribute which is an iterator over all the elements of the array:  >>> >>> for element in b.flat: ...     print(element) ... 0 1 2 3 10 11 12 13 20 21 22 23 30 31 32 33 40 41 42 43 See also Indexing, Indexing (reference), newaxis, ndenumerate, indices  Shape Manipulation Changing the shape of an array An array has a shape given by the number of elements along each axis:  >>> >>> a = np.floor(10*rg.random((3,4))) >>> a array([[3., 7., 3., 4.],        [1., 4., 2., 2.],        [7., 2., 4., 9.]]) >>> a.shape (3, 4) The shape of an array can be changed with various commands. Note that the following three commands all return a modified array, but do not change the original array:  >>> >>> a.ravel()  # returns the array, flattened array([3., 7., 3., 4., 1., 4., 2., 2., 7., 2., 4., 9.]) >>> a.reshape(6,2)  # returns the array with a modified shape array([[3., 7.],        [3., 4.],        [1., 4.],        [2., 2.],        [7., 2.],        [4., 9.]]) >>> a.T  # returns the array, transposed array([[3., 1., 7.],        [7., 4., 2.],        [3., 2., 4.],        [4., 2., 9.]]) >>> a.T.shape (4, 3) >>> a.shape (3, 4) The order of the elements in the array resulting from ravel() is normally “C-style”, that is, the rightmost index “changes the fastest”, so the element after a[0,0] is a[0,1]. If the array is reshaped to some other shape, again the array is treated as “C-style”. NumPy normally creates arrays stored in this order, so ravel() will usually not need to copy its argument, but if the array was made by taking slices of another array or created with unusual options, it may need to be copied. The functions ravel() and reshape() can also be instructed, using an optional argument, to use FORTRAN-style arrays, in which the leftmost index changes the fastest.  The reshape function returns its argument with a modified shape, whereas the ndarray.resize method modifies the array itself:  >>> >>> a array([[3., 7., 3., 4.],        [1., 4., 2., 2.],        [7., 2., 4., 9.]]) >>> a.resize((2,6)) >>> a array([[3., 7., 3., 4., 1., 4.],        [2., 2., 7., 2., 4., 9.]]) If a dimension is given as -1 in a reshaping operation, the other dimensions are automatically calculated:  >>> >>> a.reshape(3,-1) array([[3., 7., 3., 4.],        [1., 4., 2., 2.],        [7., 2., 4., 9.]]) See also ndarray.shape, reshape, resize, ravel  Stacking together different arrays Several arrays can be stacked together along different axes:  >>> >>> a = np.floor(10*rg.random((2,2))) >>> a array([[9., 7.],        [5., 2.]]) >>> b = np.floor(10*rg.random((2,2))) >>> b array([[1., 9.],        [5., 1.]]) >>> np.vstack((a,b)) array([[9., 7.],        [5., 2.],        [1., 9.],        [5., 1.]]) >>> np.hstack((a,b)) array([[9., 7., 1., 9.],        [5., 2., 5., 1.]]) The function column_stack stacks 1D arrays as columns into a 2D array. It is equivalent to hstack only for 2D arrays:  >>> >>> from numpy import newaxis >>> np.column_stack((a,b))     # with 2D arrays array([[9., 7., 1., 9.],        [5., 2., 5., 1.]]) >>> a = np.array([4.,2.]) >>> b = np.array([3.,8.]) >>> np.column_stack((a,b))     # returns a 2D array array([[4., 3.],        [2., 8.]]) >>> np.hstack((a,b))           # the result is different array([4., 2., 3., 8.]) >>> a[:,newaxis]               # view `a` as a 2D column vector array([[4.],        [2.]]) >>> np.column_stack((a[:,newaxis],b[:,newaxis])) array([[4., 3.],        [2., 8.]]) >>> np.hstack((a[:,newaxis],b[:,newaxis]))   # the result is the same array([[4., 3.],        [2., 8.]]) On the other hand, the function row_stack is equivalent to vstack for any input arrays. In fact, row_stack is an alias for vstack:  >>> >>> np.column_stack is np.hstack False >>> np.row_stack is np.vstack True In general, for arrays with more than two dimensions, hstack stacks along their second axes, vstack stacks along their first axes, and concatenate allows for an optional arguments giving the number of the axis along which the concatenation should happen.  Note  In complex cases, r_ and c_ are useful for creating arrays by stacking numbers along one axis. They allow the use of range literals (“:”)  >>> >>> np.r_[1:4,0,4] array([1, 2, 3, 0, 4]) When used with arrays as arguments, r_ and c_ are similar to vstack and hstack in their default behavior, but allow for an optional argument giving the number of the axis along which to concatenate.  See also hstack, vstack, column_stack, concatenate, c_, r_  Splitting one array into several smaller ones Using hsplit, you can split an array along its horizontal axis, either by specifying the number of equally shaped arrays to return, or by specifying the columns after which the division should occur:  >>> >>> a = np.floor(10*rg.random((2,12))) >>> a array([[6., 7., 6., 9., 0., 5., 4., 0., 6., 8., 5., 2.],        [8., 5., 5., 7., 1., 8., 6., 7., 1., 8., 1., 0.]]) # Split a into 3 >>> np.hsplit(a,3) [array([[6., 7., 6., 9.],        [8., 5., 5., 7.]]), array([[0., 5., 4., 0.],        [1., 8., 6., 7.]]), array([[6., 8., 5., 2.],        [1., 8., 1., 0.]])] # Split a after the third and the fourth column >>> np.hsplit(a,(3,4)) [array([[6., 7., 6.],        [8., 5., 5.]]), array([[9.],        [7.]]), array([[0., 5., 4., 0., 6., 8., 5., 2.],        [1., 8., 6., 7., 1., 8., 1., 0.]])] vsplit splits along the vertical axis, and array_split allows one to specify along which axis to split.  Copies and Views When operating and manipulating arrays, their data is sometimes copied into a new array and sometimes not. This is often a source of confusion for beginners. There are three cases:  No Copy at All Simple assignments make no copy of objects or their data.  >>> >>> a = np.array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3], ...               [ 4,  5,  6,  7], ...               [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]) >>> b = a            # no new object is created >>> b is a           # a and b are two names for the same ndarray object True Python passes mutable objects as references, so function calls make no copy.  >>> >>> def f(x): ...     print(id(x)) ... >>> id(a)                           # id is a unique identifier of an object 148293216  # may vary >>> f(a) 148293216  # may vary View or Shallow Copy Different array objects can share the same data. The view method creates a new array object that looks at the same data.  >>> >>> c = a.view() >>> c is a False >>> c.base is a                        # c is a view of the data owned by a True >>> c.flags.owndata False >>> >>> c = c.reshape((2, 6))                      # a's shape doesn't change >>> a.shape (3, 4) >>> c[0, 4] = 1234                      # a's data changes >>> a array([[   0,    1,    2,    3],        [1234,    5,    6,    7],        [   8,    9,   10,   11]]) Slicing an array returns a view of it:  >>> >>> s = a[ : , 1:3]     # spaces added for clarity; could also be written \"s = a[:, 1:3]\" >>> s[:] = 10           # s[:] is a view of s. Note the difference between s = 10 and s[:] = 10 >>> a array([[   0,   10,   10,    3],        [1234,   10,   10,    7],        [   8,   10,   10,   11]]) Deep Copy The copy method makes a complete copy of the array and its data.  >>> >>> d = a.copy()                          # a new array object with new data is created >>> d is a False >>> d.base is a                           # d doesn't share anything with a False >>> d[0,0] = 9999 >>> a array([[   0,   10,   10,    3],        [1234,   10,   10,    7],        [   8,   10,   10,   11]]) Sometimes copy should be called after slicing if the original array is not required anymore. For example, suppose a is a huge intermediate result and the final result b only contains a small fraction of a, a deep copy should be made when constructing b with slicing:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(int(1e8)) >>> b = a[:100].copy() >>> del a  # the memory of ``a`` can be released. If b = a[:100] is used instead, a is referenced by b and will persist in memory even if del a is executed.  Functions and Methods Overview Here is a list of some useful NumPy functions and methods names ordered in categories. See Routines for the full list.

The first rule of broadcasting is that if all input arrays do not have the same number of dimensions, a “1” will be repeatedly prepended to the shapes of the smaller arrays until all the arrays have the same number of dimensions.  The second rule of broadcasting ensures that arrays with a size of 1 along a particular dimension act as if they had the size of the array with the largest shape along that dimension. The value of the array element is assumed to be the same along that dimension for the “broadcast” array.  After application of the broadcasting rules, the sizes of all arrays must match. More details can be found in Broadcasting.  Advanced indexing and index tricks NumPy offers more indexing facilities than regular Python sequences. In addition to indexing by integers and slices, as we saw before, arrays can be indexed by arrays of integers and arrays of booleans.  Indexing with Arrays of Indices >>> >>> a = np.arange(12)**2                       # the first 12 square numbers >>> i = np.array([1, 1, 3, 8, 5])              # an array of indices >>> a[i]                                       # the elements of a at the positions i array([ 1,  1,  9, 64, 25]) >>> >>> j = np.array([[3, 4], [9, 7]])      # a bidimensional array of indices >>> a[j]                                       # the same shape as j array([[ 9, 16],        [81, 49]]) When the indexed array a is multidimensional, a single array of indices refers to the first dimension of a. The following example shows this behavior by converting an image of labels into a color image using a palette.  >>> >>> palette = np.array([[0, 0, 0],         # black ...                     [255, 0, 0],       # red ...                     [0, 255, 0],       # green ...                     [0, 0, 255],       # blue ...                     [255, 255, 255]])  # white >>> image = np.array([[0, 1, 2, 0],        # each value corresponds to a color in the palette ...                   [0, 3, 4, 0]]) >>> palette[image]                         # the (2, 4, 3) color image array([[[  0,   0,   0],         [255,   0,   0],         [  0, 255,   0],         [  0,   0,   0]],         [[  0,   0,   0],         [  0,   0, 255],         [255, 255, 255],         [  0,   0,   0]]]) We can also give indexes for more than one dimension. The arrays of indices for each dimension must have the same shape.  >>> >>> a = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4) >>> a array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],        [ 4,  5,  6,  7],        [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]) >>> i = np.array([[0, 1],                     # indices for the first dim of a ...               [1, 2]]) >>> j = np.array([[2, 1],                     # indices for the second dim ...               [3, 3]]) >>> >>> a[i, j]                                   # i and j must have equal shape array([[ 2,  5],        [ 7, 11]]) >>> >>> a[i, 2] array([[ 2,  6],        [ 6, 10]]) >>> >>> a[:, j]                                     # i.e., a[ : , j] array([[[ 2,  1],         [ 3,  3]],         [[ 6,  5],         [ 7,  7]],         [[10,  9],         [11, 11]]]) In Python, arr[i, j] is exactly the same as arr[(i, j)]—so we can put i and j in a tuple and then do the indexing with that.  >>> >>> l = (i, j) # equivalent to a[i, j] >>> a[l] array([[ 2,  5],        [ 7, 11]]) However, we can not do this by putting i and j into an array, because this array will be interpreted as indexing the first dimension of a.  >>> >>> s = np.array([i, j])  # not what we want >>> a[s] Traceback (most recent call last):   File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module> IndexError: index 3 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 3  # same as a[i, j] >>> a[tuple(s)] array([[ 2,  5],        [ 7, 11]]) Another common use of indexing with arrays is the search of the maximum value of time-dependent series:  >>> >>> time = np.linspace(20, 145, 5)                 # time scale >>> data = np.sin(np.arange(20)).reshape(5,4)      # 4 time-dependent series >>> time array([ 20.  ,  51.25,  82.5 , 113.75, 145.  ]) >>> data array([[ 0.        ,  0.84147098,  0.90929743,  0.14112001],        [-0.7568025 , -0.95892427, -0.2794155 ,  0.6569866 ],        [ 0.98935825,  0.41211849, -0.54402111, -0.99999021],        [-0.53657292,  0.42016704,  0.99060736,  0.65028784],        [-0.28790332, -0.96139749, -0.75098725,  0.14987721]])  # index of the maxima for each series >>> ind = data.argmax(axis=0) >>> ind array([2, 0, 3, 1])  # times corresponding to the maxima >>> time_max = time[ind] >>> >>> data_max = data[ind, range(data.shape[1])] # => data[ind[0],0], data[ind[1],1]...  >>> time_max array([ 82.5 ,  20.  , 113.75,  51.25]) >>> data_max array([0.98935825, 0.84147098, 0.99060736, 0.6569866 ])  >>> np.all(data_max == data.max(axis=0)) True You can also use indexing with arrays as a target to assign to:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(5) >>> a array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) >>> a[[1,3,4]] = 0 >>> a array([0, 0, 2, 0, 0]) However, when the list of indices contains repetitions, the assignment is done several times, leaving behind the last value:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(5) >>> a[[0,0,2]]=[1,2,3] >>> a array([2, 1, 3, 3, 4]) This is reasonable enough, but watch out if you want to use Python’s += construct, as it may not do what you expect:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(5) >>> a[[0,0,2]]+=1 >>> a array([1, 1, 3, 3, 4]) Even though 0 occurs twice in the list of indices, the 0th element is only incremented once. This is because Python requires “a+=1” to be equivalent to “a = a + 1”.  Indexing with Boolean Arrays When we index arrays with arrays of (integer) indices we are providing the list of indices to pick. With boolean indices the approach is different; we explicitly choose which items in the array we want and which ones we don’t.  The most natural way one can think of for boolean indexing is to use boolean arrays that have the same shape as the original array:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4) >>> b = a > 4 >>> b                                          # b is a boolean with a's shape array([[False, False, False, False],        [False,  True,  True,  True],        [ True,  True,  True,  True]]) >>> a[b]                                       # 1d array with the selected elements array([ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11]) This property can be very useful in assignments:  >>> >>> a[b] = 0                                   # All elements of 'a' higher than 4 become 0 >>> a array([[0, 1, 2, 3],        [4, 0, 0, 0],        [0, 0, 0, 0]]) You can look at the following example to see how to use boolean indexing to generate an image of the Mandelbrot set:  >>> import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def mandelbrot( h,w, maxit=20 ):     \"\"\"Returns an image of the Mandelbrot fractal of size (h,w).\"\"\"     y,x = np.ogrid[ -1.4:1.4:h*1j, -2:0.8:w*1j ]     c = x+y*1j     z = c     divtime = maxit + np.zeros(z.shape, dtype=int)      for i in range(maxit):         z = z**2 + c         diverge = z*np.conj(z) > 2**2            # who is diverging         div_now = diverge & (divtime==maxit)  # who is diverging now         divtime[div_now] = i                  # note when         z[diverge] = 2                        # avoid diverging too much      return divtime plt.imshow(mandelbrot(400,400)) ../_images/quickstart-1.png The second way of indexing with booleans is more similar to integer indexing; for each dimension of the array we give a 1D boolean array selecting the slices we want:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4) >>> b1 = np.array([False,True,True])             # first dim selection >>> b2 = np.array([True,False,True,False])       # second dim selection >>> >>> a[b1,:]                                   # selecting rows array([[ 4,  5,  6,  7],        [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]) >>> >>> a[b1]                                     # same thing array([[ 4,  5,  6,  7],        [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]) >>> >>> a[:,b2]                                   # selecting columns array([[ 0,  2],        [ 4,  6],        [ 8, 10]]) >>> >>> a[b1,b2]                                  # a weird thing to do array([ 4, 10]) Note that the length of the 1D boolean array must coincide with the length of the dimension (or axis) you want to slice. In the previous example, b1 has length 3 (the number of rows in a), and b2 (of length 4) is suitable to index the 2nd axis (columns) of a.  The ix_() function The ix_ function can be used to combine different vectors so as to obtain the result for each n-uplet. For example, if you want to compute all the a+b*c for all the triplets taken from each of the vectors a, b and c:  >>> >>> a = np.array([2,3,4,5]) >>> b = np.array([8,5,4]) >>> c = np.array([5,4,6,8,3]) >>> ax,bx,cx = np.ix_(a,b,c) >>> ax array([[[2]],         [[3]],         [[4]],         [[5]]]) >>> bx array([[[8],         [5],         [4]]]) >>> cx array([[[5, 4, 6, 8, 3]]]) >>> ax.shape, bx.shape, cx.shape ((4, 1, 1), (1, 3, 1), (1, 1, 5)) >>> result = ax+bx*cx >>> result array([[[42, 34, 50, 66, 26],         [27, 22, 32, 42, 17],         [22, 18, 26, 34, 14]],         [[43, 35, 51, 67, 27],         [28, 23, 33, 43, 18],         [23, 19, 27, 35, 15]],         [[44, 36, 52, 68, 28],         [29, 24, 34, 44, 19],         [24, 20, 28, 36, 16]],         [[45, 37, 53, 69, 29],         [30, 25, 35, 45, 20],         [25, 21, 29, 37, 17]]]) >>> result[3,2,4] 17 >>> a[3]+b[2]*c[4] 17 You could also implement the reduce as follows:  >>> >>> def ufunc_reduce(ufct, *vectors): ...    vs = np.ix_(*vectors) ...    r = ufct.identity ...    for v in vs: ...        r = ufct(r,v) ...    return r and then use it as:  >>> >>> ufunc_reduce(np.add,a,b,c) array([[[15, 14, 16, 18, 13],         [12, 11, 13, 15, 10],         [11, 10, 12, 14,  9]],         [[16, 15, 17, 19, 14],         [13, 12, 14, 16, 11],         [12, 11, 13, 15, 10]],         [[17, 16, 18, 20, 15],         [14, 13, 15, 17, 12],         [13, 12, 14, 16, 11]],         [[18, 17, 19, 21, 16],         [15, 14, 16, 18, 13],         [14, 13, 15, 17, 12]]]) The advantage of this version of reduce compared to the normal ufunc.reduce is that it makes use of the Broadcasting Rules in order to avoid creating an argument array the size of the output times the number of vectors.

The normalized (unit \"length\") eigenvectors, such that the     column ``v[:,i]`` is the eigenvector corresponding to the     eigenvalue ``w[i]`` . Tricks and Tips Here we give a list of short and useful tips.  “Automatic” Reshaping To change the dimensions of an array, you can omit one of the sizes which will then be deduced automatically:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(30) >>> b = a.reshape((2, -1, 3))  # -1 means \"whatever is needed\" >>> b.shape (2, 5, 3) >>> b array([[[ 0,  1,  2],         [ 3,  4,  5],         [ 6,  7,  8],         [ 9, 10, 11],         [12, 13, 14]],         [[15, 16, 17],         [18, 19, 20],         [21, 22, 23],         [24, 25, 26],         [27, 28, 29]]]) Vector Stacking How do we construct a 2D array from a list of equally-sized row vectors? In MATLAB this is quite easy: if x and y are two vectors of the same length you only need do m=[x;y]. In NumPy this works via the functions column_stack, dstack, hstack and vstack, depending on the dimension in which the stacking is to be done. For example:  >>> >>> x = np.arange(0,10,2) >>> y = np.arange(5) >>> m = np.vstack([x,y]) >>> m array([[0, 2, 4, 6, 8],        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]]) >>> xy = np.hstack([x,y]) >>> xy array([0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) The logic behind those functions in more than two dimensions can be strange.  See also NumPy for Matlab users  Histograms The NumPy histogram function applied to an array returns a pair of vectors: the histogram of the array and a vector of the bin edges. Beware: matplotlib also has a function to build histograms (called hist, as in Matlab) that differs from the one in NumPy. The main difference is that pylab.hist plots the histogram automatically, while numpy.histogram only generates the data.  >>> import numpy as np rg = np.random.default_rng(1) import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Build a vector of 10000 normal deviates with variance 0.5^2 and mean 2 mu, sigma = 2, 0.5 v = rg.normal(mu,sigma,10000) # Plot a normalized histogram with 50 bins plt.hist(v, bins=50, density=1)       # matplotlib version (plot) # Compute the histogram with numpy and then plot it (n, bins) = np.histogram(v, bins=50, density=True)  # NumPy version (no plot) plt.plot(.5*(bins[1:]+bins[:-1]), n) ../_images/quickstart-2.png Further reading The Python tutorial  NumPy Reference  SciPy Tutorial  SciPy Lecture Notes  A matlab, R, IDL, NumPy/SciPy dictionary  © Copyright 2008-2020, The SciPy community.

    "content": "Classification - Machine Learning This is ‘Classification’ tutorial which is a part of the Machine Learning course offered by Simplilearn. We will learn Classification algorithms, types of classification algorithms, support vector machines(SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier in this tutorial.  Objectives Let us look at some of the objectives covered under this section of Machine Learning tutorial.  Define Classification and list its algorithms Describe Logistic Regression and Sigmoid Probability Explain K-Nearest Neighbors and KNN classification Understand Support Vector Machines, Polynomial Kernel, and Kernel Trick Analyze Kernel Support Vector Machines with an example Implement the Naïve Bayes Classifier Demonstrate Decision Tree Classifier Describe Random Forest Classifier Classification: Meaning Classification is a type of supervised learning. It specifies the class to which data elements belong to and is best used when the output has finite and discrete values. It predicts a class for an input variable as well.  There are 2 types of Classification:   Binomial Multi-Class Classification: Use Cases Some of the key areas where classification cases are being used:  To find whether an email received is a spam or ham To identify customer segments To find if a bank loan is granted To identify if a kid will pass or fail in an examination Classification: Example Social media sentiment analysis has two potential outcomes, positive or negative, as displayed by the chart given below.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/classification-example-machine-learning.JPG  This chart shows the classification of the Iris flower dataset into its three sub-species indicated by codes 0, 1, and 2. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/iris-flower-dataset-graph.JPG  The test set dots represent the assignment of new test data points to one class or the other based on the trained classifier model. Types of Classification Algorithms Let’s have a quick look into the types of Classification Algorithm below.  Linear Models Logistic Regression Support Vector Machines Nonlinear models K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) Kernel Support Vector Machines (SVM) Naïve Bayes Decision Tree Classification Random Forest Classification Logistic Regression: Meaning Let us understand the Logistic Regression model below.  This refers to a regression model that is used for classification. This method is widely used for binary classification problems. It can also be extended to multi-class classification problems. Here, the dependent variable is categorical: y ϵ {0, 1} A binary dependent variable can have only two values, like 0 or 1, win or lose, pass or fail, healthy or sick, etc In this case, you model the probability distribution of output y as 1 or 0. This is called the sigmoid probability (σ). If σ(θ Tx) > 0.5, set y = 1, else set y = 0 Unlike Linear Regression (and its Normal Equation solution), there is no closed form solution for finding optimal weights of Logistic Regression. Instead, you must solve this with maximum likelihood estimation (a probability model to detect the maximum likelihood of something happening). It can be used to calculate the probability of a given outcome in a binary model, like the probability of being classified as sick or passing an exam. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/logistic-regression-example-graph.JPG  Sigmoid Probability The probability in the logistic regression is often represented by the Sigmoid function (also called the logistic function or the S-curve):  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/sigmoid-function-machine-learning.JPG  In this equation, t represents data values * the number of hours studied and S(t) represents the probability of passing the exam. Assume sigmoid function: https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/sigmoid-probability-machine-learning.JPG  g(z) tends toward 1 as z -> infinity , and g(z) tends toward 0 as z -> infinity  K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) K-nearest Neighbors algorithm is used to assign a data point to clusters based on similarity measurement. It uses a supervised method for classification.  The steps to writing a k-means algorithm are as given below:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/knn-distribution-graph-machine-learning.JPG  Choose the number of k and a distance metric. (k = 5 is common) Find k-nearest neighbors of the sample that you want to classify Assign the class label by majority vote. KNN Classification A new input point is classified in the category such that it has the most number of neighbors from that category. For example:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/knn-classification-machine-learning.JPG  Classify a patient as high risk or low risk. Mark email as spam or ham. Keen on learning about Classification Algorithms in Machine Learning? Click here!  Support Vector Machine (SVM) Let us understand Support Vector Machine (SVM) in detail below.  SVMs are classification algorithms used to assign data to various classes. They involve detecting hyperplanes which segregate data into classes. SVMs are very versatile and are also capable of performing linear or nonlinear classification, regression, and outlier detection. Once ideal hyperplanes are discovered, new data points can be easily classified. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/support-vector-machines-graph-machine-learning.JPG  The optimization objective is to find “maximum margin hyperplane” that is farthest from the closest points in the two classes (these points are called support vectors). In the given figure, the middle line represents the hyperplane. SVM Example Let’s look at this image below and have an idea about SVM in general.  Hyperplanes with larger margins have lower generalization error. The positive and negative hyperplanes are represented by: https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/positive-negative-hyperplanes-machine-learning.JPG  Classification of any new input sample xtest :  If w0 + wTxtest > 1, the sample xtest is said to be in the class toward the right of the positive hyperplane. If w0 + wTxtest < -1, the sample xtest is said to be in the class toward the left of the negative hyperplane. When you subtract the two equations, you get:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/equation-subtraction-machine-learning.JPG  Length of vector w is (L2 norm length):  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/length-of-vector-machine-learning.JPG  You normalize with the length of w to arrive at:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/normalize-equation-machine-learning.JPG  SVM: Hard Margin Classification Given below are some points to understand Hard Margin Classification.  The left side of equation SVM-1 given above can be interpreted as the distance between the positive (+ve) and negative (-ve) hyperplanes; in other words, it is the margin that can be maximized. Hence the objective of the function is to maximize with the constraint that the samples are classified correctly, which is represented as : https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/hard-margin-classification-machine-learning.JPG  This means that you are minimizing ‖w‖. This also means that all positive samples are on one side of the positive hyperplane and all negative samples are on the other side of the negative hyperplane. This can be written concisely as : https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/hard-margin-classification-formula.JPG  Minimizing ‖w‖ is the same as minimizing. This figure is better as it is differentiable even at w = 0. The approach listed above is called “hard margin linear SVM classifier.” SVM: Soft Margin Classification   Given below are some points to understand Soft Margin Classification.  To allow for linear constraints to be relaxed for nonlinearly separable data, a slack variable is introduced. (i) measures how much ith instance is allowed to violate the margin. The slack variable is simply added to the linear constraints. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/soft-margin-calculation-machine-learning.JPG  Subject to the above constraints, the new objective to be minimized becomes: https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/soft-margin-calculation-formula.JPG  You have two conflicting objectives now—minimizing slack variable to reduce margin violations and minimizing to increase the margin. The hyperparameter C allows us to define this trade-off. Large values of C correspond to larger error penalties (so smaller margins), whereas smaller values of C allow for higher misclassification errors and larger margins. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/machine-learning-certification-video-preview.jpg  SVM: Regularization The concept of C is the reverse of regularization. Higher C means lower regularization, which increases bias and lowers the variance (causing overfitting).  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/concept-of-c-graph-machine-learning.JPG  IRIS Data Set The Iris dataset contains measurements of 150 IRIS flowers from three different species:  Setosa Versicolor Viriginica Each row represents one sample. Flower measurements in centimeters are stored as columns. These are called features.  IRIS Data Set: SVM Let’s train an SVM model using sci-kit-learn for the Iris dataset:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/svm-model-graph-machine-learning.JPG  Nonlinear SVM Classification There are two ways to solve nonlinear SVMs:  by adding polynomial features by adding similarity features Polynomial features can be added to datasets; in some cases, this can create a linearly separable dataset.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/nonlinear-classification-svm-machine-learning.JPG  In the figure on the left, there is only 1 feature x1. This dataset is not linearly separable. If you add x2 = (x1)2 (figure on the right), the data becomes linearly separable. Polynomial Kernel In sci-kit-learn, one can use a Pipeline class for creating polynomial features. Classification results for the Moons dataset are shown in the figure.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/polynomial-kernel-machine-learning.JPG  Polynomial Kernel with Kernel Trick Let us look at the image below and understand Kernel Trick in detail.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/polynomial-kernel-with-kernel-trick.JPG  For large dimensional datasets, adding too many polynomial features can slow down the model. You can apply a kernel trick with the effect of polynomial features without actually adding them. The code is shown (SVC class) below trains an SVM classifier using a 3rd-degree polynomial kernel but with a kernel trick. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/polynomial-kernel-equation-machine-learning.JPG  The hyperparameter coefθ controls the influence of high-degree polynomials.  Kernel SVM Let us understand in detail about Kernel SVM.  Kernel SVMs are used for classification of nonlinear data. In the chart, nonlinear data is projected into a higher dimensional space via a mapping function where it becomes linearly separable. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/kernel-svm-machine-learning.JPG  In the higher dimension, a linear separating hyperplane can be derived and used for classification.  A reverse projection of the higher dimension back to original feature space takes it back to nonlinear shape.  As mentioned previously, SVMs can be kernelized to solve nonlinear classification problems. You can create a sample dataset for XOR gate (nonlinear problem) from NumPy. 100 samples will be assigned the class sample 1, and 100 samples will be assigned the class label -1. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/kernel-svm-graph-machine-learning.JPG  As you can see, this data is not linearly separable.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/kernel-svm-non-separable.JPG  You now use the kernel trick to classify XOR dataset created earlier.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/kernel-svm-xor-machine-learning.JPG  Naïve Bayes Classifier What is Naive Bayes Classifier?  Have you ever wondered how your mail provider implements spam filtering or how online news channels perform news text classification or even how companies perform sentiment analysis of their audience on social media? All of this and more are done through a machine learning algorithm called Naive Bayes Classifier.  Naive Bayes Named after Thomas Bayes from the 1700s who first coined this in the Western literature. Naive Bayes classifier works on the principle of conditional probability as given by the Bayes theorem.  Advantages of Naive Bayes Classifier Listed below are six benefits of Naive Bayes Classifier.  Very simple and easy to implement Needs less training data Handles both continuous and discrete data Highly scalable with the number of predictors and data points As it is fast, it can be used in real-time predictions Not sensitive to irrelevant features Bayes Theorem We will understand Bayes Theorem in detail from the points mentioned below.  According to the Bayes model, the conditional probability P(Y|X) can be calculated as:  P(Y|X) = P(X|Y)P(Y) / P(X)  This means you have to estimate a very large number of P(X|Y) probabilities for a relatively small vector space X. For example, for a Boolean Y and 30 possible Boolean attributes in the X vector, you will have to estimate 3 billion probabilities P(X|Y). To make it practical, a Naïve Bayes classifier is used, which assumes conditional independence of P(X) to each other, with a given value of Y. This reduces the number of probability estimates to 2*30=60 in the above example. Naïve Bayes Classifier for SMS Spam Detection Consider a labeled SMS database having 5574 messages. It has messages as given below:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/naive-bayes-spam-machine-learning.JPG  Each message is marked as spam or ham in the data set. Let’s train a model with Naïve Bayes algorithm to detect spam from ham. The message lengths and their frequency (in the training dataset) are as shown below:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/naive-bayes-spam-spam-detection.JPG  Analyze the logic you use to train an algorithm to detect spam:  Split each message into individual words/tokens (bag of words). Lemmatize the data (each word takes its base form, like “walking” or “walked” is replaced with “walk”). Convert data to vectors using scikit-learn module CountVectorizer. Run TFIDF to remove common words like “is,” “are,” “and.” Now apply scikit-learn module for Naïve Bayes MultinomialNB to get the Spam Detector. This spam detector can then be used to classify a random new message as spam or ham. Next, the accuracy of the spam detector is checked using the Confusion Matrix. For the SMS spam example above, the confusion matrix is shown on the right. Accuracy Rate = Correct / Total = (4827 + 592)/5574 = 97.21% Error Rate = Wrong / Total = (155 + 0)/5574 = 2.78% https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/confusion-matrix-machine-learning.JPG  Although confusion Matrix is useful, some more precise metrics are provided by Precision and Recall.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/precision-recall-matrix-machine-learning.JPG  Precision refers to the accuracy of positive predictions.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/precision-formula-machine-learning.JPG  Recall refers to the ratio of positive instances that are correctly detected by the classifier (also known as True positive rate or TPR).  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/recall-formula-machine-learning.JPG  Precision/Recall Trade-off To detect age-appropriate videos for kids, you need high precision (low recall) to ensure that only safe videos make the cut (even though a few safe videos may be left out).  The high recall is needed (low precision is acceptable) in-store surveillance to catch shoplifters; a few false alarms are acceptable, but all shoplifters must be caught.  Learn about Naive Bayes in detail. Click here!  Decision Tree Classifier Some aspects of the Decision Tree Classifier mentioned below are.  Decision Trees (DT) can be used both for classification and regression. The advantage of decision trees is that they require very little data preparation. They do not require feature scaling or centering at all. They are also the fundamental components of Random Forests, one of the most powerful ML algorithms. Unlike Random Forests and Neural Networks (which do black-box modeling), Decision Trees are white box models, which means that inner workings of these models are clearly understood. In the case of classification, the data is segregated based on a series of questions. Any new data point is assigned to the selected leaf node. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/decision-tree-classifier-machine-learning.JPG  Start at the tree root and split the data on the feature using the decision algorithm, resulting in the largest information gain (IG). This splitting procedure is then repeated in an iterative process at each child node until the leaves are pure. This means that the samples at each node belonging to the same class. In practice, you can set a limit on the depth of the tree to prevent overfitting. The purity is compromised here as the final leaves may still have some impurity. The figure shows the classification of the Iris dataset. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/decision-tree-classifier-graph.JPG  IRIS Decision Tree Let’s build a Decision Tree using scikit-learn for the Iris flower dataset and also visualize it using export_graphviz API.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/iris-decision-tree-machine-learning.JPG  The output of export_graphviz can be converted into png format:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/iris-decision-tree-output.JPG  Sample attribute stands for the number of training instances the node applies to. Value attribute stands for the number of training instances of each class the node applies to. Gini impurity measures the node’s impurity. A node is “pure” (gini=0) if all training instances it applies to belong to the same class. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/impurity-formula-machine-learning.JPG  For example, for Versicolor (green color node), the Gini is 1-(0/54)2 -(49/54)2 -(5/54) 2 ≈ 0.168  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/iris-decision-tree-sample.JPG  Decision Boundaries Let us learn to create decision boundaries below.  For the first node (depth 0), the solid line splits the data (Iris-Setosa on left). Gini is 0 for Setosa node, so no further split is possible. The second node (depth 1) splits the data into Versicolor and Virginica. If max_depth were set as 3, a third split would happen (vertical dotted line). https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/decision-tree-boundaries.JPG  For a sample with petal length 5 cm and petal width 1.5 cm, the tree traverses to depth 2 left node, so the probability predictions for this sample are 0% for Iris-Setosa (0/54), 90.7% for Iris-Versicolor (49/54), and 9.3% for Iris-Virginica (5/54) CART Training Algorithm Scikit-learn uses Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm to train Decision Trees. CART algorithm:  Split the data into two subsets using a single feature k and threshold tk (example, petal length < “2.45 cm”). This is done recursively for each node. k and tk are chosen such that they produce the purest subsets (weighted by their size). The objective is to minimize the cost function as given below: https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/cart-training-algorithm-machine-learning.JPG  The algorithm stops executing if one of the following situations occurs: max_depth is reached No further splits are found for each node Other hyperparameters may be used to stop the tree: min_samples_split min_samples_leaf min_weight_fraction_leaf max_leaf_nodes Gini Impurity or Entropy Entropy is one more measure of impurity and can be used in place of Gini.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/gini-impurity-entrophy.JPG  It is a degree of uncertainty, and Information Gain is the reduction that occurs in entropy as one traverses down the tree. Entropy is zero for a DT node when the node contains instances of only one class. Entropy for depth 2 left node in the example given above is:  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/entrophy-for-depth-2.JPG  Gini and Entropy both lead to similar trees.  DT: Regularization The following figure shows two decision trees on the moons dataset.  https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/dt-regularization-machine-learning.JPG  The decision tree on the right is restricted by min_samples_leaf = 4. The model on the left is overfitting, while the model on the right generalizes better. Random Forest Classifier Let us have an understanding of Random Forest Classifier below.  A random forest can be considered an ensemble of decision trees (Ensemble learning). Random Forest algorithm: Draw a random bootstrap sample of size n (randomly choose n samples from the training set). Grow a decision tree from the bootstrap sample. At each node, randomly select d features. Split the node using the feature that provides the best split according to the objective function, for instance by maximizing the information gain. Repeat the steps 1 to 2 k times. (k is the number of trees you want to create, using a subset of samples) Aggregate the prediction by each tree for a new data point to assign the class label by majority vote (pick the group selected by the most number of trees and assign new data point to that group). Random Forests are opaque, which means it is difficult to visualize their inner workings. https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/random-forest-classifier-graph.JPG  However, the advantages outweigh their limitations since you do not have to worry about hyperparameters except k, which stands for the number of decision trees to be created from a subset of samples. RF is quite robust to noise from the individual decision trees. Hence, you need not prune individual decision trees. The larger the number of decision trees, the more accurate the Random Forest prediction is. (This, however, comes with higher computation cost). Key Takeaways Let us quickly run through what we have learned so far in this Classification tutorial.  Classification algorithms are supervised learning methods to split data into classes. They can work on Linear Data as well as Nonlinear Data. Logistic Regression can classify data based on weighted parameters and sigmoid conversion to calculate the probability of classes. K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm uses similar features to classify data. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classify data by detecting the maximum margin hyperplane between data classes. Naïve Bayes, a simplified Bayes Model, can help classify data using conditional probability models. Decision Trees are powerful classifiers and use tree splitting logic until pure or somewhat pure leaf node classes are attained. Random Forests apply Ensemble Learning to Decision Trees for more accurate classification predictions. Conclusion This completes ‘Classification’ tutorial. In the next tutorial, we will learn 'Unsupervised Learning with Clustering.'",

    "content": "Python is an object oriented high level programming language. One of the simplest programming languages of all, and also the most used language for creating System Security programs. It is Simple, yet the most powerful programming language which is very close to the Machine Language. If you have never programmed before, but you have little knowledge of how a computer works, then this the right place to start. After learning this course, one can start to build their own System programs, and also basic malware testing programs. This course is for those who want to learn how to program in python. It is intended to suit a wide audience, though not for absolute beginners. This course is targeted towards people who already have basic in either python or any other programming language. This course takes in consideration that you already know what loops, conditions, statements and variables are. This course will take you through the following chapters: Abstraction I and II, Exceptions in programs, Methods, properties and iterators, Standard Libraries and Python programming with Files. This will complete your intermediate training in Python Programming and how data structures are created and implemented in software’s. If you already know python, but other versions earlier than Python3.0, then you can start with this course to upgrade yourself with necessary modules. Some of the material in this course may be a bit difficult for an inexperienced programmer. However, once you start writing and practicing the examples in this course and writing your own codes based on these examples, then it will become quite practical for you to understand these terms. If you don’t understand some specific terms in the first bit, go through the tutorials again. Practice and Repetition are the keys to learning. This Course is in depth summary of the Core of Python. So, if you already have the basics in python, then it will be extremely easy to understand. Even if you don’t have the basics, then you can just search the specific terms used in here, understand only those and then come back to clear the advanced topics in these tutorials. This course will take you through the journey of interacting with system files using IDLE or the Python Interpreter, Creating your own servers and clients using socket programming, Understanding the database support for python with SQlite.  There are also chapters which will teach you how to create your own programs which can interact with open files in any platform (UNIX, Linux, Windows or Mac). There is also a vast area covered in this course about Web Programming with Python covering the four most important topics as CGI, Screen Scraping, mod_python and Web Services. And finally there is testing, debugging and logging in Python. So, by completing this course, you will finally be able to write your own programs and test them on various platforms. The Main Idea of this course is to make the learner an advanced programmer having knowledge in bits and bytes in all various environments in Python programming.  What are the requirements?  Basics in Any Programming Language Basic Computer Knowledge Basics in Python such as ‘loops, variables, conditions and statements’(knowing any other language would be an added advantage) Basics in Python (knowing basic C,C++ and a bit about network programming would be an added advantage) What am I going to get from this course?

    "content": "to the left & scrollbar to the right so that they both appear parallel & perfect. Buttons: We will add two button widgets on the window. One is to add more tasks in Listbox and the other is to delete tasks from Listbox. Entry box: Users will type the task in the entry box which further will be displayed in the Listbox. Messagebox: The Python Tkinter message box is used to display an error message when the user clicks on the add button with an empty entry box. Code explanation for ToDo list in Python Tkinter In this section, we will understand the source code for the ToDo list in Python Tkinter. The entire code is explained in a sequence of creation.  Step 1 : Import Modules  Before we start using Tkinter, we need to call Tkinter for use. so we import the module. Here * means everything. So we are importing everything from Tkinter then in the second line we have imported message box from Tkinter  from tkinter import * from tkinter import messagebox  Step 2: Create & Configure Window  After importing module, we will create a window so that we can place widgets on it.  ws is used to initialize Tk(). From now ws will be called as the parent window. All other widgets will be placed on it. ws.geometry(‘width x height + x-position+ y-position’) All the values provided must be integers. the width refers to the horizontal space of the window. height refers to the vertical space of the window. x-position refers to the position of the window on the display over the x-axis. y-position refers to the position of the window on the display over the y-axis. the title will add a title to the window. In our case, we have provided our website name as a title. You can find the title on the top left of the window next to feather. config is used to provide background color to the window. resizable accepts boolean values. Since the boolean values are provided false for both height and width that means the window can’t be resized. To know more about resizable please read our blog on python Tkinter windows size. ws.mainloop() holds the screen so that we can see the window. It is an infinite loop. screen pops up and then disappears but with this infinite loop this process of appearing & disappearing keeps on happening very fast. And we keep on seeing the updated window. ws = Tk() ws.geometry('500x450+500+200') ws.title('PythonGuides') ws.config(bg='#223441') ws.resizable(width=False, height=False)  .... ....  ws.mainloop()  Step 3: Creating a frame  In this section we will understand why we have used frames as a first widget in our code.  Frame widgets are used to hold other widgets. They help in keeping & maintaining user interface (UI) & user experience (UX) clean & organized. Moving forward we will place Listbox, scrollbars & buttons inside the frame. So in this way frame will act as an additional window over the parent window. Another benefit of placing a frame is now we will add scrollbars to the frame and that solves our purpose. Scrollbars are no easy to place but using frames we can do it in no time. pady=10 means we have added extra padding around the frame from outside. frame = Frame(ws) frame.pack(pady=10) Step 4: Adding Listbox  In this section, we will learn why and how we have used Listbox on the window.  lb is the variable name for storing Listbox. Listbox is placed on the frame window. width: Horizontal space provided is 25. height: 8 rows in the vertical position are provided. font: Times New Roman font is provided with 14 sizes. bd = 0 refers to the border is zero fg is the foreground color or the text color. highlightthickness=0 every time the focus is moved to any item then it should not show any movement that is value 0 value is provided. by default it has some value.  selectbackground it decides the color of the focused item in the Listbox. activestyle=”none” removes the underline that appears when the item is selected or focused. geometry manager used is pack() side=LEFTthis will keep the Listbox to the left side of the frame. We did this on purpose so that we can assign the right position to scrollbars. fill=BOTH this will fill the blank space in both the directions that are x and y lb = Listbox(     frame,     width=25,     height=8,     font=('Times', 18),     bd=0,     fg='#464646',     highlightthickness=0,     selectbackground='#a6a6a6',     activestyle=\"none\",      ) lb.pack(side=LEFT, fill=BOTH) Step 5: Adding dummy data  We have added dummy data so that the application is ready to view. You add or delete whatever data you want. the data is in a list format and is stored in a variable named task_list. for loop is used to insert data in the Listbox. every time loop runs it adds an item to the Listbox & this process keeps on going until all the items in the task_list are inserted. lb.insert(END, item) this command stacks the items in Listbox. lb is the variable used for Listbox insert is a built-in method of Listbox to insert data. END signifies that a new item will be added in the end. If END is replaced with 0 then new data will be added at the top. item is the list item from task_list  task_list = [     'Eat apple',     'drink water',     'go gym',     'write software',     'write documentation',     'take a nap',     'Learn something',     'paint canvas'     ]   for item in task_list:     lb.insert(END, item) Step 6: Adding Scrollbars  In this section, we will understand why and how scrollbars are added to the window.  Scrollbars are used so that users can scroll the information that is placed in a limited size on the window. In this scrollbars are placed on a frame and the variable assigned is sb The geometry method used is a pack() so that everything remains dynamic and in a sequence. side=RIGHT we have placed scrollbars on the right side of the frame. In the above code, we have provided side=LEFT to Listbox. So in this way, both the widgets are assigned paralleled. fill=BOTH this will fill the blank space in both the directions that are x and y lb.config(yscrollcommand=sb.set) here we have assigned a purpose to the scrollbar. In other words, we have bind Listbox with scrollbar sb.config(command=lb.yview), here yview means scrollbar will go in the vertical direction. If it would have been xview then the scrollbar would have worked in the horizontal direction.  sb = Scrollbar(frame) sb.pack(side=RIGHT, fill=BOTH)  lb.config(yscrollcommand=sb.set) sb.config(command=lb.yview)  Step 7: Adding Entry Box  Entry box is used to take input from the user. ws: entry box is placed on the parent window font: provides font name i.e ‘Times New Roman’ and size is 14 Geometry manager used is pack with padding of 20 outside the widget my_entry = Entry(     ws,     font=('times', 24)     )  my_entry.pack(pady=20) Step: 8 Adding another frame for buttons  Frames are used to organise the widgets. We have used separate frame for buttons.  button_frame = Frame(ws) button_frame.pack(pady=20) Step 9: Adding Buttons  Buttons are placed to trigger some action when pressed. Here we have created two button (addTask & deleteTask). Both of them have same features and look accept the background color and command. Command: When button is clicked the the function mentioned in command is called. In this case if user clicks on addTask_btn button then newTask function is called & when user clicks on the delTask_btn Button then delTask function is called.  addTask_btn = Button(     button_frame,     text='Add Task',     font=('times 14'),     bg='#c5f776',     padx=20,     pady=10,     command=newTask ) addTask_btn.pack(fill=BOTH, expand=True, side=LEFT)  delTask_btn = Button(     button_frame,     text='Delete Task',     font=('times 14'),     bg='#ff8b61',     padx=20,     pady=10,     command=deleteTask ) delTask_btn.pack(fill=BOTH, expand=True, side=LEFT) Step 10: newTask() function  In this function, we have stored the value of the entry box in the task variable get() method is used to pull the value provided by the user in the entry box. If-else condition is applied to avoid black space entry in the Listbox. if the task does not have blank space then only it will allow it to store the information in the Listbox otherwise it will display a warning message box informing the user that the entry box can’t be empty. def newTask():     task = my_entry.get()     if task != \"\":         lb.insert(END, task)         my_entry.delete(0, \"end\")     else:         messagebox.showwarning(\"warning\", \"Please enter some task.\") Step 11: deleteTask() function   Here ANCHOR refers to the selected item in the Listbox. lb variable assigned to Listbox delete is a built-in function to delete Listbox item. User will select the item in the Listbox and then to trigger this function he/she will click on the deleteTask button. Immediately the item will disappear from the Listbox. def deleteTask():     lb.delete(ANCHOR)",

    "title": "Install NumPy array operations for beginners",
    "content": "Quickstart tutorial Prerequisites Before reading this tutorial you should know a bit of Python. If you would like to refresh your memory, take a look at the Python tutorial.  If you wish to work the examples in this tutorial, you must also have some software installed on your computer. Please see https://scipy.org/install.html for instructions.  Learner profile  This tutorial is intended as a quick overview of algebra and arrays in NumPy and want to understand how n-dimensional (n>=2) arrays are represented and can be manipulated. In particular, if you don’t know how to apply common functions to n-dimensional arrays (without using for-loops), or if you want to understand axis and shape properties for n-dimensional arrays, this tutorial might be of help.  Learning Objectives  After this tutorial, you should be able to:  Understand the difference between one-, two- and n-dimensional arrays in NumPy;  Understand how to apply some linear algebra operations to n-dimensional arrays without using for-loops;  Understand axis and shape properties for n-dimensional arrays.  The Basics NumPy’s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. In NumPy dimensions are called axes.  For example, the coordinates of a point in 3D space [1, 2, 1] has one axis. That axis has 3 elements in it, so we say it has a length of 3. In the example pictured below, the array has 2 axes. The first axis has a length of 2, the second axis has a length of 3.  [[ 1., 0., 0.],  [ 0., 1., 2.]] NumPy’s array class is called ndarray. It is also known by the alias array. Note that numpy.array is not the same as the Standard Python Library class array.array, which only handles one-dimensional arrays and offers less functionality. The more important attributes of an ndarray object are:  ndarray.ndim the number of axes (dimensions) of the array.  ndarray.shape the dimensions of the array. This is a tuple of integers indicating the size of the array in each dimension. For a matrix with n rows and m columns, shape will be (n,m). The length of the shape tuple is therefore the number of axes, ndim.  ndarray.size the total number of elements of the array. This is equal to the product of the elements of shape.  ndarray.dtype an object describing the type of the elements in the array. One can create or specify dtype’s using standard Python types. Additionally NumPy provides types of its own. numpy.int32, numpy.int16, and numpy.float64 are some examples.  ndarray.itemsize the size in bytes of each element of the array. For example, an array of elements of type float64 has itemsize 8 (=64/8), while one of type complex32 has itemsize 4 (=32/8). It is equivalent to ndarray.dtype.itemsize.  ndarray.data the buffer containing the actual elements of the array. Normally, we won’t need to use this attribute because we will access the elements in an array using indexing facilities.  An example >>> import numpy as np a = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5) a array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],        [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9],        [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]]) a.shape (3, 5) a.ndim 2 a.dtype.name 'int64' a.itemsize 8 a.size 15 type(a) <class 'numpy.ndarray'> b = np.array([6, 7, 8]) b array([6, 7, 8]) type(b) <class 'numpy.ndarray'> Array Creation There are several ways to create arrays.  For example, you can create an array from a regular Python list or tuple using the array function. The type of the resulting array is deduced from the type of the elements in the sequences.  >>> >>> import numpy as np >>> a = np.array([2,3,4]) >>> a array([2, 3, 4]) >>> a.dtype dtype('int64') >>> b = np.array([1.2, 3.5, 5.1]) >>> b.dtype dtype('float64') A frequent error consists in calling array with multiple arguments, rather than providing a single sequence as an argument.  >>> >>> a = np.array(1,2,3,4)    # WRONG Traceback (most recent call last):   ... TypeError: array() takes from 1 to 2 positional arguments but 4 were given >>> a = np.array([1,2,3,4])  # RIGHT array transforms sequences of sequences into two-dimensional arrays, sequences of sequences of sequences into three-dimensional arrays, and so on.  >>> >>> b = np.array([(1.5,2,3), (4,5,6)]) >>> b array([[1.5, 2. , 3. ],        [4. , 5. , 6. ]]) The type of the array can also be explicitly specified at creation time:  >>> >>> c = np.array( [ [1,2], [3,4] ], dtype=complex ) >>> c array([[1.+0.j, 2.+0.j],        [3.+0.j, 4.+0.j]]) Often, the elements of an array are originally unknown, but its size is known. Hence, NumPy offers several functions to create arrays with initial placeholder content. These minimize the necessity of growing arrays, an expensive operation.  The function zeros creates an array full of zeros, the function ones creates an array full of ones, and the function empty creates an array whose initial content is random and depends on the state of the memory. By default, the dtype of the created array is float64.  >>> >>> np.zeros((3, 4)) array([[0., 0., 0., 0.],        [0., 0., 0., 0.],        [0., 0., 0., 0.]]) >>> np.ones( (2,3,4), dtype=np.int16 )                # dtype can also be specified array([[[1, 1, 1, 1],         [1, 1, 1, 1],         [1, 1, 1, 1]],         [[1, 1, 1, 1],         [1, 1, 1, 1],         [1, 1, 1, 1]]], dtype=int16) >>> np.empty( (2,3) )                                 # uninitialized array([[  3.73603959e-262,   6.02658058e-154,   6.55490914e-260],  # may vary        [  5.30498948e-313,   3.14673309e-307,   1.00000000e+000]]) To create sequences of numbers, NumPy provides the arange function which is analogous to the Python built-in range, but returns an array.  >>> >>> np.arange( 10, 30, 5 ) array([10, 15, 20, 25]) >>> np.arange( 0, 2, 0.3 )                 # it accepts float arguments array([0. , 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8]) When arange is used with floating point arguments, it is generally not possible to predict the number of elements obtained, due to the finite floating point precision. For this reason, it is usually better to use the function linspace that receives as an argument the number of elements that we want, instead of the step:  >>> >>> from numpy import pi >>> np.linspace( 0, 2, 9 )                 # 9 numbers from 0 to 2 array([0.  , 0.25, 0.5 , 0.75, 1.  , 1.25, 1.5 , 1.75, 2.  ]) >>> x = np.linspace( 0, 2*pi, 100 )        # useful to evaluate function at lots of points >>> f = np.sin(x) See also array, zeros, zeros_like, ones, ones_like, empty, empty_like, arange, linspace, numpy.random.Generator.rand, numpy.random.Generator.randn, fromfunction, fromfile  Printing Arrays When you print an array, NumPy displays it in a similar way to nested lists, but with the following layout:  the last axis is printed from left to right,  the second-to-last is printed from top to bottom,  the rest are also printed from top to bottom, with each slice separated from the next by an empty line.  One-dimensional arrays are then printed as rows, bidimensionals as matrices and tridimensionals as lists of matrices.  >>> >>> a = np.arange(6)                         # 1d array >>> print(a) [0 1 2 3 4 5] >>> >>> b = np.arange(12).reshape(4,3)           # 2d array >>> print(b) [[ 0  1  2]  [ 3  4  5]  [ 6  7  8]  [ 9 10 11]] >>> >>> c = np.arange(24).reshape(2,3,4)         # 3d array >>> print(c) [[[ 0  1  2  3]   [ 4  5  6  7]   [ 8  9 10 11]]   [[12 13 14 15]   [16 17 18 19]   [20 21 22 23]]] See below to get more details on reshape.  If an array is too large to be printed, NumPy automatically skips the central part of the array and only prints the corners:  >>> >>> print(np.arange(10000)) [   0    1    2 ... 9997 9998 9999] >>> >>> print(np.arange(10000).reshape(100,100)) [[   0    1    2 ...   97   98   99]  [ 100  101  102 ...  197  198  199]  [ 200  201  202 ...  297  298  299]  ...  [9700 9701 9702 ... 9797 9798 9799]  [9800 9801 9802 ... 9897 9898 9899]  [9900 9901 9902 ... 9997 9998 9999]] To disable this behaviour and force NumPy to print the entire array, you can change the printing options using set_printoptions.  >>> >>> np.set_printoptions(threshold=sys.maxsize)       # sys module should be imported Basic Operations Arithmetic operators on arrays apply elementwise. A new array is created and filled with the result.  >>> >>> a = np.array( [20,30,40,50] ) >>> b = np.arange( 4 ) >>> b array([0, 1, 2, 3]) >>> c = a-b >>> c array([20, 29, 38, 47]) >>> b**2 array([0, 1, 4, 9]) >>> 10*np.sin(a) array([ 9.12945251, -9.88031624,  7.4511316 , -2.62374854]) >>> a<35 array([ True,  True, False, False]) Unlike in many matrix languages, the product operator * operates elementwise in NumPy arrays. The matrix product can be performed using the @ operator (in python >=3.5) or the dot function or method:  >>> >>> A = np.array( [[1,1], ...                [0,1]] ) >>> B = np.array( [[2,0], ...                [3,4]] ) >>> A * B                       # elementwise product array([[2, 0],        [0, 4]]) >>> A @ B                       # matrix product array([[5, 4],        [3, 4]]) >>> A.dot(B)                    # another matrix product array([[5, 4],        [3, 4]]) Some operations, such as += and *=, act in place to modify an existing array rather than create a new one.  >>> >>> rg = np.random.default_rng(1)     # create instance of default random number generator >>> a = np.ones((2,3), dtype=int) >>> b = rg.random((2,3)) >>> a *= 3 >>> a array([[3, 3, 3],        [3, 3, 3]]) >>> b += a >>> b array([[3.51182162, 3.9504637 , 3.14415961],        [3.94864945, 3.31183145, 3.42332645]]) >>> a += b                            # b is not automatically converted to integer type Traceback (most recent call last):     ... numpy.core._exceptions.UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'add' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') with casting rule 'same_kind' When operating with arrays of different types, the type of the resulting array corresponds to the more general or precise one (a behavior known as upcasting).  >>> >>> a = np.ones(3, dtype=np.int32) >>> b = np.linspace(0,pi,3) >>> b.dtype.name 'float64' >>> c = a+b >>> c array([1.        , 2.57079633, 4.14159265]) >>> c.dtype.name 'float64' >>> d = np.exp(c*1j) >>> d array([ 0.54030231+0.84147098j, -0.84147098+0.54030231j,        -0.54030231-0.84147098j]) >>> d.dtype.name 'complex128' Many unary operations, such as computing the sum of all the elements in the array, are implemented as methods of the ndarray class.  >>> >>> a = rg.random((2,3)) >>> a array([[0.82770259, 0.40919914, 0.54959369],        [0.02755911, 0.75351311, 0.53814331]]) >>> a.sum() 3.1057109529998157 >>> a.min() 0.027559113243068367 >>> a.max() 0.8277025938204418 By default, these operations apply to the array as though it were a list of numbers, regardless of its shape. However, by specifying the axis parameter you can apply an operation along the specified axis of an array:  >>> >>> b = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4) >>> b array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],        [ 4,  5,  6,  7],        [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]) >>> >>> b.sum(axis=0)                            # sum of each column array([12, 15, 18, 21]) >>> >>> b.min(axis=1)                            # min of each row array([0, 4, 8]) >>> >>> b.cumsum(axis=1)                         # cumulative sum along each row array([[ 0,  1,  3,  6],        [ 4,  9, 15, 22],        [ 8, 17, 27, 38]]) Universal Functions NumPy provides familiar mathematical functions such as sin, cos, and exp. In NumPy, these are called “universal functions”(ufunc). Within NumPy, these functions operate elementwise on an array, producing an array as output.  >>> >>> B = np.arange(3) >>> B array([0, 1, 2]) >>> np.exp(B) array([1.        , 2.71828183, 7.3890561 ]) >>> np.sqrt(B) array([0.        , 1.        , 1.41421356]) >>> C = np.array([2., -1., 4.]) >>> np.add(B, C) array([2., 0., 6.]) See also all, any, apply_along_axis, argmax, argmin, argsort, average, bincount, ceil, clip, conj, corrcoef, cov, cross, cumprod, cumsum, diff, dot, floor, inner, invert, lexsort, max, maximum, mean, median, min, minimum, nonzero, outer, prod, re, round, sort, std, sum, trace, transpose, var, vdot, vectorize, where  Indexing, Slicing and Iterating One-dimensional arrays can be indexed, sliced and iterated over, much like lists and other Python sequences.  >>> >>> a = np.arange(10)**3 >>> a array([  0,   1,   8,  27,  64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729]) >>> a[2] 8 >>> a[2:5] array([ 8, 27, 64]) # equivalent to a[0:6:2] = 1000; # from start to position 6, exclusive, set every 2nd element to 1000 >>> a[:6:2] = 1000 >>> a array([1000,    1, 1000,   27, 1000,  125,  216,  343,  512,  729]) >>> a[ : :-1]                                 # reversed a array([ 729,  512,  343,  216,  125, 1000,   27, 1000,    1, 1000]) >>> for i in a: ...     print(i**(1/3.)) ... 9.999999999999998 1.0 9.999999999999998 3.0 9.999999999999998 4.999999999999999 5.999999999999999 6.999999999999999 7.999999999999999 8.999999999999998 Multidimensional arrays can have one index per axis. These indices are given in a tuple separated by commas:  >>> >>> def f(x,y): ...     return 10*x+y ... >>> b = np.fromfunction(f,(5,4),dtype=int) >>> b array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],        [10, 11, 12, 13],        [20, 21, 22, 23],        [30, 31, 32, 33],        [40, 41, 42, 43]]) >>> b[2,3] 23 >>> b[0:5, 1]                       # each row in the second column of b array([ 1, 11, 21, 31, 41]) >>> b[ : ,1]                        # equivalent to the previous example array([ 1, 11, 21, 31, 41]) >>> b[1:3, : ]                      # each column in the second and third row of b array([[10, 11, 12, 13],        [20, 21, 22, 23]]) When fewer indices are provided than the number of axes, the missing indices are considered complete slices:  >>> >>> b[-1]                                  # the last row. Equivalent to b[-1,:] array([40, 41, 42, 43]) The expression within brackets in b[i] is treated as an i followed by as many instances of : as needed to represent the remaining axes. NumPy also allows you to write this using dots as b[i,...].  The dots (...) represent as many colons as needed to produce a complete indexing tuple. For example, if x is an array with 5 axes, then  x[1,2,...] is equivalent to x[1,2,:,:,:],  x[...,3] to x[:,:,:,:,3] and  x[4,...,5,:] to x[4,:,:,5,:].  >>> >>> c = np.array( [[[  0,  1,  2],               # a 3D array (two stacked 2D arrays) ...                 [ 10, 12, 13]], ...                [[100,101,102], ...                 [110,112,113]]]) >>> c.shape (2, 2, 3) >>> c[1,...]                                   # same as c[1,:,:] or c[1] array([[100, 101, 102],        [110, 112, 113]]) >>> c[...,2]                                   # same as c[:,:,2] array([[  2,  13],        [102, 113]]) Iterating over multidimensional arrays is done with respect to the first axis:  >>> >>> for row in b: ...     print(row) ... [0 1 2 3] [10 11 12 13] [20 21 22 23] [30 31 32 33] [40 41 42 43] However, if one wants to perform an operation on each element in the array, one can use the flat attribute which is an iterator over all the elements of the array:  >>> >>> for element in b.flat: ...     print(element) ... 0 1 2 3 10 11 12 13 20 21 22 23 30 31 32 33 40 41 42 43 See also Indexing, Indexing (reference), newaxis, ndenumerate, indices  Shape Manipulation Changing the shape of an array An array has a shape given by the number of elements along each axis:  >>> >>> a = np.floor(10*rg.random((3,4))) >>> a array([[3., 7., 3., 4.],        [1., 4., 2., 2.],        [7., 2., 4., 9.]]) >>> a.shape (3, 4) The shape of an array can be changed with various commands. Note that the following three commands all return a modified array, but do not change the original array:  >>> >>> a.ravel()  # returns the array, flattened array([3., 7., 3., 4., 1., 4., 2., 2., 7., 2., 4., 9.]) >>> a.reshape(6,2)  # returns the array with a modified shape array([[3., 7.],        [3., 4.],        [1., 4.],        [2., 2.],        [7., 2.],        [4., 9.]]) >>> a.T  # returns the array, transposed array([[3., 1., 7.],        [7., 4., 2.],        [3., 2., 4.],        [4., 2., 9.]]) >>> a.T.shape (4, 3) >>> a.shape (3, 4) The order of the elements in the array resulting from ravel() is normally “C-style”, that is, the rightmost index “changes the fastest”, so the element after a[0,0] is a[0,1]. If the array is reshaped to some other shape, again the array is treated as “C-style”. NumPy normally creates arrays stored in this order, so ravel() will usually not need to copy its argument, but if the array was made by taking slices of another array or created with unusual options, it may need to be copied. The functions ravel() and reshape() can also be instructed, using an optional argument, to use FORTRAN-style arrays, in which the leftmost index changes the fastest.  The reshape function returns its argument with a modified shape, whereas the ndarray.resize method modifies the array itself:  >>> >>> a array([[3., 7., 3., 4.],        [1., 4., 2., 2.],        [7., 2., 4., 9.]]) >>> a.resize((2,6)) >>> a array([[3., 7., 3., 4., 1., 4.],        [2., 2., 7., 2., 4., 9.]]) If a dimension is given as -1 in a reshaping operation, the other dimensions are automatically calculated:  >>> >>> a.reshape(3,-1) array([[3., 7., 3., 4.],        [1., 4., 2., 2.],        [7., 2., 4., 9.]]) See also ndarray.shape, reshape, resize, ravel  Stacking together different arrays Several arrays can be stacked together along different axes:  >>> >>> a = np.floor(10*rg.random((2,2))) >>> a array([[9., 7.],        [5., 2.]]) >>> b = np.floor(10*rg.random((2,2))) >>> b array([[1., 9.],        [5., 1.]]) >>> np.vstack((a,b)) array([[9., 7.],        [5., 2.],        [1., 9.],        [5., 1.]]) >>> np.hstack((a,b)) array([[9., 7., 1., 9.],        [5., 2., 5., 1.]]) The function column_stack stacks 1D arrays as columns into a 2D array. It is equivalent to hstack only for 2D arrays:  >>> >>> from numpy import newaxis >>> np.column_stack((a,b))     # with 2D arrays array([[9., 7., 1., 9.],        [5., 2., 5., 1.]]) >>> a = np.array([4.,2.]) >>> b = np.array([3.,8.]) >>> np.column_stack((a,b))     # returns a 2D array array([[4., 3.],        [2., 8.]]) >>> np.hstack((a,b))           # the result is different array([4., 2., 3., 8.]) >>> a[:,newaxis]               # view `a` as a 2D column vector array([[4.],        [2.]]) >>> np.column_stack((a[:,newaxis],b[:,newaxis])) array([[4., 3.],        [2., 8.]]) >>> np.hstack((a[:,newaxis],b[:,newaxis]))   # the result is the same array([[4., 3.],        [2., 8.]]) On the other hand, the function row_stack is equivalent to vstack for any input arrays. In fact, row_stack is an alias for vstack:  >>> >>> np.column_stack is np.hstack False >>> np.row_stack is np.vstack True In general, for arrays with more than two dimensions, hstack stacks along their second axes, vstack stacks along their first axes, and concatenate allows for an optional arguments giving the number of the axis along which the concatenation should happen.  Note  In complex cases, r_ and c_ are useful for creating arrays by stacking numbers along one axis. They allow the use of range literals (“:”)  >>> >>> np.r_[1:4,0,4] array([1, 2, 3, 0, 4]) When used with arrays as arguments, r_ and c_ are similar to vstack and hstack in their default behavior, but allow for an optional argument giving the number of the axis along which to concatenate.  See also hstack, vstack, column_stack, concatenate, c_, r_  Splitting one array into several smaller ones Using hsplit, you can split an array along its horizontal axis, either by specifying the number of equally shaped arrays to return, or by specifying the columns after which the division should occur:  >>> >>> a = np.floor(10*rg.random((2,12))) >>> a array([[6., 7., 6., 9., 0., 5., 4., 0., 6., 8., 5., 2.],        [8., 5., 5., 7., 1., 8., 6., 7., 1., 8., 1., 0.]]) # Split a into 3 >>> np.hsplit(a,3) [array([[6., 7., 6., 9.],        [8., 5., 5., 7.]]), array([[0., 5., 4., 0.],        [1., 8., 6., 7.]]), array([[6., 8., 5., 2.],        [1., 8., 1., 0.]])] # Split a after the third and the fourth column >>> np.hsplit(a,(3,4)) [array([[6., 7., 6.],        [8., 5., 5.]]), array([[9.],        [7.]]), array([[0., 5., 4., 0., 6., 8., 5., 2.],        [1., 8., 6., 7., 1., 8., 1., 0.]])] vsplit splits along the vertical axis, and array_split allows one to specify along which axis to split.  Copies and Views When operating and manipulating arrays, their data is sometimes copied into a new array and sometimes not. This is often a source of confusion for beginners. There are three cases:  No Copy at All Simple assignments make no copy of objects or their data.  >>> >>> a = np.array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3], ...               [ 4,  5,  6,  7], ...               [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]) >>> b = a            # no new object is created >>> b is a           # a and b are two names for the same ndarray object True Python passes mutable objects as references, so function calls make no copy.  >>> >>> def f(x): ...     print(id(x)) ... >>> id(a)                           # id is a unique identifier of an object 148293216  # may vary >>> f(a) 148293216  # may vary View or Shallow Copy Different array objects can share the same data. The view method creates a new array object that looks at the same data.  >>> >>> c = a.view() >>> c is a False >>> c.base is a                        # c is a view of the data owned by a True >>> c.flags.owndata False >>> >>> c = c.reshape((2, 6))                      # a's shape doesn't change >>> a.shape (3, 4) >>> c[0, 4] = 1234                      # a's data changes >>> a array([[   0,    1,    2,    3],        [1234,    5,    6,    7],        [   8,    9,   10,   11]]) Slicing an array returns a view of it:  >>> >>> s = a[ : , 1:3]     # spaces added for clarity; could also be written \"s = a[:, 1:3]\" >>> s[:] = 10           # s[:] is a view of s. Note the difference between s = 10 and s[:] = 10 >>> a array([[   0,   10,   10,    3],        [1234,   10,   10,    7],        [   8,   10,   10,   11]]) Deep Copy The copy method makes a complete copy of the array and its data.  >>> >>> d = a.copy()                          # a new array object with new data is created >>> d is a False >>> d.base is a                           # d doesn't share anything with a False >>> d[0,0] = 9999 >>> a array([[   0,   10,   10,    3],        [1234,   10,   10,    7],        [   8,   10,   10,   11]]) Sometimes copy should be called after slicing if the original array is not required anymore. For example, suppose a is a huge intermediate result and the final result b only contains a small fraction of a, a deep copy should be made when constructing b with slicing:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(int(1e8)) >>> b = a[:100].copy() >>> del a  # the memory of ``a`` can be released. If b = a[:100] is used instead, a is referenced by b and will persist in memory even if del a is executed.  Functions and Methods Overview Here is a list of some useful NumPy functions and methods names ordered in categories. See Routines for the full list.

The first rule of broadcasting is that if all input arrays do not have the same number of dimensions, a “1” will be repeatedly prepended to the shapes of the smaller arrays until all the arrays have the same number of dimensions.  The second rule of broadcasting ensures that arrays with a size of 1 along a particular dimension act as if they had the size of the array with the largest shape along that dimension. The value of the array element is assumed to be the same along that dimension for the “broadcast” array.  After application of the broadcasting rules, the sizes of all arrays must match. More details can be found in Broadcasting.  Advanced indexing and index tricks NumPy offers more indexing facilities than regular Python sequences. In addition to indexing by integers and slices, as we saw before, arrays can be indexed by arrays of integers and arrays of booleans.  Indexing with Arrays of Indices >>> >>> a = np.arange(12)**2                       # the first 12 square numbers >>> i = np.array([1, 1, 3, 8, 5])              # an array of indices >>> a[i]                                       # the elements of a at the positions i array([ 1,  1,  9, 64, 25]) >>> >>> j = np.array([[3, 4], [9, 7]])      # a bidimensional array of indices >>> a[j]                                       # the same shape as j array([[ 9, 16],        [81, 49]]) When the indexed array a is multidimensional, a single array of indices refers to the first dimension of a. The following example shows this behavior by converting an image of labels into a color image using a palette.  >>> >>> palette = np.array([[0, 0, 0],         # black ...                     [255, 0, 0],       # red ...                     [0, 255, 0],       # green ...                     [0, 0, 255],       # blue ...                     [255, 255, 255]])  # white >>> image = np.array([[0, 1, 2, 0],        # each value corresponds to a color in the palette ...                   [0, 3, 4, 0]]) >>> palette[image]                         # the (2, 4, 3) color image array([[[  0,   0,   0],         [255,   0,   0],         [  0, 255,   0],         [  0,   0,   0]],         [[  0,   0,   0],         [  0,   0, 255],         [255, 255, 255],         [  0,   0,   0]]]) We can also give indexes for more than one dimension. The arrays of indices for each dimension must have the same shape.  >>> >>> a = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4) >>> a array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],        [ 4,  5,  6,  7],        [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]) >>> i = np.array([[0, 1],                     # indices for the first dim of a ...               [1, 2]]) >>> j = np.array([[2, 1],                     # indices for the second dim ...               [3, 3]]) >>> >>> a[i, j]                                   # i and j must have equal shape array([[ 2,  5],        [ 7, 11]]) >>> >>> a[i, 2] array([[ 2,  6],        [ 6, 10]]) >>> >>> a[:, j]                                     # i.e., a[ : , j] array([[[ 2,  1],         [ 3,  3]],         [[ 6,  5],         [ 7,  7]],         [[10,  9],         [11, 11]]]) In Python, arr[i, j] is exactly the same as arr[(i, j)]—so we can put i and j in a tuple and then do the indexing with that.  >>> >>> l = (i, j) # equivalent to a[i, j] >>> a[l] array([[ 2,  5],        [ 7, 11]]) However, we can not do this by putting i and j into an array, because this array will be interpreted as indexing the first dimension of a.  >>> >>> s = np.array([i, j])  # not what we want >>> a[s] Traceback (most recent call last):   File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module> IndexError: index 3 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 3  # same as a[i, j] >>> a[tuple(s)] array([[ 2,  5],        [ 7, 11]]) Another common use of indexing with arrays is the search of the maximum value of time-dependent series:  >>> >>> time = np.linspace(20, 145, 5)                 # time scale >>> data = np.sin(np.arange(20)).reshape(5,4)      # 4 time-dependent series >>> time array([ 20.  ,  51.25,  82.5 , 113.75, 145.  ]) >>> data array([[ 0.        ,  0.84147098,  0.90929743,  0.14112001],        [-0.7568025 , -0.95892427, -0.2794155 ,  0.6569866 ],        [ 0.98935825,  0.41211849, -0.54402111, -0.99999021],        [-0.53657292,  0.42016704,  0.99060736,  0.65028784],        [-0.28790332, -0.96139749, -0.75098725,  0.14987721]])  # index of the maxima for each series >>> ind = data.argmax(axis=0) >>> ind array([2, 0, 3, 1])  # times corresponding to the maxima >>> time_max = time[ind] >>> >>> data_max = data[ind, range(data.shape[1])] # => data[ind[0],0], data[ind[1],1]...  >>> time_max array([ 82.5 ,  20.  , 113.75,  51.25]) >>> data_max array([0.98935825, 0.84147098, 0.99060736, 0.6569866 ])  >>> np.all(data_max == data.max(axis=0)) True You can also use indexing with arrays as a target to assign to:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(5) >>> a array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) >>> a[[1,3,4]] = 0 >>> a array([0, 0, 2, 0, 0]) However, when the list of indices contains repetitions, the assignment is done several times, leaving behind the last value:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(5) >>> a[[0,0,2]]=[1,2,3] >>> a array([2, 1, 3, 3, 4]) This is reasonable enough, but watch out if you want to use Python’s += construct, as it may not do what you expect:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(5) >>> a[[0,0,2]]+=1 >>> a array([1, 1, 3, 3, 4]) Even though 0 occurs twice in the list of indices, the 0th element is only incremented once. This is because Python requires “a+=1” to be equivalent to “a = a + 1”.  Indexing with Boolean Arrays When we index arrays with arrays of (integer) indices we are providing the list of indices to pick. With boolean indices the approach is different; we explicitly choose which items in the array we want and which ones we don’t.  The most natural way one can think of for boolean indexing is to use boolean arrays that have the same shape as the original array:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4) >>> b = a > 4 >>> b                                          # b is a boolean with a's shape array([[False, False, False, False],        [False,  True,  True,  True],        [ True,  True,  True,  True]]) >>> a[b]                                       # 1d array with the selected elements array([ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11]) This property can be very useful in assignments:  >>> >>> a[b] = 0                                   # All elements of 'a' higher than 4 become 0 >>> a array([[0, 1, 2, 3],        [4, 0, 0, 0],        [0, 0, 0, 0]]) You can look at the following example to see how to use boolean indexing to generate an image of the Mandelbrot set:  >>> import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def mandelbrot( h,w, maxit=20 ):     \"\"\"Returns an image of the Mandelbrot fractal of size (h,w).\"\"\"     y,x = np.ogrid[ -1.4:1.4:h*1j, -2:0.8:w*1j ]     c = x+y*1j     z = c     divtime = maxit + np.zeros(z.shape, dtype=int)      for i in range(maxit):         z = z**2 + c         diverge = z*np.conj(z) > 2**2            # who is diverging         div_now = diverge & (divtime==maxit)  # who is diverging now         divtime[div_now] = i                  # note when         z[diverge] = 2                        # avoid diverging too much      return divtime plt.imshow(mandelbrot(400,400)) ../_images/quickstart-1.png The second way of indexing with booleans is more similar to integer indexing; for each dimension of the array we give a 1D boolean array selecting the slices we want:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4) >>> b1 = np.array([False,True,True])             # first dim selection >>> b2 = np.array([True,False,True,False])       # second dim selection >>> >>> a[b1,:]                                   # selecting rows array([[ 4,  5,  6,  7],        [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]) >>> >>> a[b1]                                     # same thing array([[ 4,  5,  6,  7],        [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]) >>> >>> a[:,b2]                                   # selecting columns array([[ 0,  2],        [ 4,  6],        [ 8, 10]]) >>> >>> a[b1,b2]                                  # a weird thing to do array([ 4, 10]) Note that the length of the 1D boolean array must coincide with the length of the dimension (or axis) you want to slice. In the previous example, b1 has length 3 (the number of rows in a), and b2 (of length 4) is suitable to index the 2nd axis (columns) of a.  The ix_() function The ix_ function can be used to combine different vectors so as to obtain the result for each n-uplet. For example, if you want to compute all the a+b*c for all the triplets taken from each of the vectors a, b and c:  >>> >>> a = np.array([2,3,4,5]) >>> b = np.array([8,5,4]) >>> c = np.array([5,4,6,8,3]) >>> ax,bx,cx = np.ix_(a,b,c) >>> ax array([[[2]],         [[3]],         [[4]],         [[5]]]) >>> bx array([[[8],         [5],         [4]]]) >>> cx array([[[5, 4, 6, 8, 3]]]) >>> ax.shape, bx.shape, cx.shape ((4, 1, 1), (1, 3, 1), (1, 1, 5)) >>> result = ax+bx*cx >>> result array([[[42, 34, 50, 66, 26],         [27, 22, 32, 42, 17],         [22, 18, 26, 34, 14]],         [[43, 35, 51, 67, 27],         [28, 23, 33, 43, 18],         [23, 19, 27, 35, 15]],         [[44, 36, 52, 68, 28],         [29, 24, 34, 44, 19],         [24, 20, 28, 36, 16]],         [[45, 37, 53, 69, 29],         [30, 25, 35, 45, 20],         [25, 21, 29, 37, 17]]]) >>> result[3,2,4] 17 >>> a[3]+b[2]*c[4] 17 You could also implement the reduce as follows:  >>> >>> def ufunc_reduce(ufct, *vectors): ...    vs = np.ix_(*vectors) ...    r = ufct.identity ...    for v in vs: ...        r = ufct(r,v) ...    return r and then use it as:  >>> >>> ufunc_reduce(np.add,a,b,c) array([[[15, 14, 16, 18, 13],         [12, 11, 13, 15, 10],         [11, 10, 12, 14,  9]],         [[16, 15, 17, 19, 14],         [13, 12, 14, 16, 11],         [12, 11, 13, 15, 10]],         [[17, 16, 18, 20, 15],         [14, 13, 15, 17, 12],         [13, 12, 14, 16, 11]],         [[18, 17, 19, 21, 16],         [15, 14, 16, 18, 13],         [14, 13, 15, 17, 12]]]) The advantage of this version of reduce compared to the normal ufunc.reduce is that it makes use of the Broadcasting Rules in order to avoid creating an argument array the size of the output times the number of vectors.

The normalized (unit \"length\") eigenvectors, such that the     column ``v[:,i]`` is the eigenvector corresponding to the     eigenvalue ``w[i]`` . Tricks and Tips Here we give a list of short and useful tips.  “Automatic” Reshaping To change the dimensions of an array, you can omit one of the sizes which will then be deduced automatically:  >>> >>> a = np.arange(30) >>> b = a.reshape((2, -1, 3))  # -1 means \"whatever is needed\" >>> b.shape (2, 5, 3) >>> b array([[[ 0,  1,  2],         [ 3,  4,  5],         [ 6,  7,  8],         [ 9, 10, 11],         [12, 13, 14]],         [[15, 16, 17],         [18, 19, 20],         [21, 22, 23],         [24, 25, 26],         [27, 28, 29]]]) Vector Stacking How do we construct a 2D array from a list of equally-sized row vectors? In MATLAB this is quite easy: if x and y are two vectors of the same length you only need do m=[x;y]. In NumPy this works via the functions column_stack, dstack, hstack and vstack, depending on the dimension in which the stacking is to be done. For example:  >>> >>> x = np.arange(0,10,2) >>> y = np.arange(5) >>> m = np.vstack([x,y]) >>> m array([[0, 2, 4, 6, 8],        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]]) >>> xy = np.hstack([x,y]) >>> xy array([0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) The logic behind those functions in more than two dimensions can be strange.  See also NumPy for Matlab users  Histograms The NumPy histogram function applied to an array returns a pair of vectors: the histogram of the array and a vector of the bin edges. Beware: matplotlib also has a function to build histograms (called hist, as in Matlab) that differs from the one in NumPy. The main difference is that pylab.hist plots the histogram automatically, while numpy.histogram only generates the data.  >>> import numpy as np rg = np.random.default_rng(1) import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Build a vector of 10000 normal deviates with variance 0.5^2 and mean 2 mu, sigma = 2, 0.5 v = rg.normal(mu,sigma,10000) # Plot a normalized histogram with 50 bins plt.hist(v, bins=50, density=1)       # matplotlib version (plot) # Compute the histogram with numpy and then plot it (n, bins) = np.histogram(v, bins=50, density=True)  # NumPy version (no plot) plt.plot(.5*(bins[1:]+bins[:-1]), n) ../_images/quickstart-2.png Further reading The Python tutorial  NumPy Reference  SciPy Tutorial  SciPy Lecture Notes  A matlab, R, IDL, NumPy/SciPy dictionary  © Copyright 2008-2020, The SciPy community.

Some additions have been made. ###### I'm new to data science and programming. Some areas of study in this roadmap may be researched to a point of redundancy while materials for other topics could be seriously lacking. As I progress through this learning path, I'll be able to gauge which areas need more (or less) focus and will add and remove resources as needed.  ## Schoolwork ##### Required readings for my Data Science classes. - [ ] [Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline](https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Data-Science-Straight-Frontline/dp/1449358659) by Cathy O'Neil & Rachel Schutt   - [ ] 1.

    "content": "What is Python? Executive Summary Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.   Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.  What is Python? Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.  It is used for:  web development (server-side), software development, mathematics, system scripting.  What can Python do?  Python can be used on a server to create web applications. Python can be used alongside software to create workflows. Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files. Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics. Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.  Why Python?  Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc). Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages. Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick. Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.  Good to know  The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular. In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.  Python Syntax compared to other programming languages  Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics. Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses. Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.  Applications for Python  Python is used in many application domains. Here's a sampling.  The Python Package Index lists thousands of third party modules for Python.  Web and Internet Development  Python offers many choices for web development:  Frameworks such as Django and Pyramid. Micro-frameworks such as Flask and Bottle. Advanced content management systems such as Plone and django CMS.  Python's standard library supports many Internet protocols:  HTML and XML JSON E-mail processing. Support for FTP, IMAP, and other Internet protocols. Easy-to-use socket interface.  And the Package Index has yet more libraries:  Requests, a powerful HTTP client library. Beautiful Soup, an HTML parser that can handle all sorts of oddball HTML. Feedparser for parsing RSS/Atom feeds. Paramiko, implementing the SSH2 protocol. Twisted Python, a framework for asynchronous network programming.  Scientific and Numeric  Python is widely used in scientific and numeric computing:  SciPy is a collection of packages for mathematics, science, and engineering.  Pandas is a data analysis and modeling library. IPython is a powerful interactive shell that features easy editing and recording of a work session, and supports visualizations and parallel computing.  The Software Carpentry Course teaches basic skills for scientific computing, running bootcamps and providing open-access teaching materials. Education Python is a superb language for teaching programming, both at the introductory level and in more advanced courses.  Books such as How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science, and Practical Programming. The Education Special Interest Group is a good place to discuss teaching issues. Desktop GUIs The Tk GUI library is included with most binary distributions of Python.  Some toolkits that are usable on several platforms are available separately:  wxWidgets Kivy, for writing multitouch applications. Qt via pyqt or pyside Platform-specific toolkits are also available:  GTK+ Microsoft Foundation Classes through the win32 extensions Software Development Python is often used as a support language for software developers, for build control and management, testing, and in many other ways.  SCons for build control.  Buildbot and Apache Gump for automated continuous compilation and testing. Roundup or Trac for bug tracking and project management. Business Applications Python is also used to build ERP and e-commerce systems:  Odoo is an all-in-one management software that offers a range of business applications that form a complete suite of enterprise management applications. Try ton is a three-tier high-level general purpose application platform.",

    "content": "This is the most modern and comprehensive course available for Spring Framework 5 and Spring Boot 2.   All source code examples used in this course have been developed using the latest version of the Spring Framework - Spring Framework 5 and Spring Boot 2.  In this course, you will build multiple real world applications using Spring Framework 5.   You will see how modern Spring Framework development is done by leveraging the features of Spring Boot 2.   Jump In and Build a Spring MVC App with Spring Boot!  We'll jump right into web development with the Spring Framework. I'll show you how kick off a Spring Boot project by using the Spring Initializr. We will then go step by step to build a simple Book / Author web application.   You will see how easy it is to use Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Spring Data JPA to create a functional web application running under Tomcat with a H2 in-memory database.  Use Test Driven Development!  In addition to teaching you Spring Framework 5, you will learn about modern best practices used in enterprise application development.   As we build the applications, you'll see me using Test Driven Development (TDD) with JUnit and Mockito.  Using Mockito mocks keeps your Spring Framework unit tests light and fast!  You'll also see how the Spring context can be used for more complex integration tests.  These techniques are best practices used by companies all over the world to build and manage large scale Spring Framework applications.  GitHub Source Code  You will have complete access to all source code examples used in the course.  In each lesson where we write code, you will have a link to GitHub with two branches in the Github repository.   The first branch is the starting state of the code.   The second branch is the ending state of the code.   You can see exactly what changed in each lesson. Each step of the way, you have a working example you can use for troubleshooting.  In fact, you will get access to 15 (and growing!) different GitHub repositories - each packed with Spring Framework programming examples.   And, you're encouraged to fork my GitHub repositories so you can share the Spring Framework applications, which you built, to future employers!   Continuous Integration Builds  Since we are using GitHub and have great test coverage, I also show you how easy it is to set up Continuous Integration builds with CircleCI.   Continuous Integration builds are another best practice used by enterprise developers.   Using CircleCI makes your CI builds a snap!  Project Lombok  We all know Java development can require a lot of boiler plate code. It's just the nature of Java.  Would you like to see how to slash your boiler plate code using Project Lombok?  Spring Data JPA and Hibernate  Spring MVC and Hibernate have long been cornerstones of the Spring Framework. You will learn how to use Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA and Hibernate to build a real world web application. You'll learn about Hibernate configuration, and about the mapping of JPA entities.   The Thymeleaf template engine is hugely popular with the Spring community. You will see how easy Spring Boot makes using Thymeleaf with Spring MVC.  While Bootstrap CSS is not a focus of the course, we will leverage Bootstrap CSS to make our web pages look awesome!  Spring MVC  Spring MVC has a lot of robust capabilities.  I start you off showing you how to build recipe application (using TDD, of course).   Initially, it's all happy path development. We go back and add custom exception handling, form validation, and internationalization.  Reactive Programming  A big theme of Spring Framework 5 is Reactive Programming.   Inside the course we build a web application using Thymeleaf, Spring MVC, Spring Data MongoDB, and MongoDB.  We then take the MongoDB application we built and convert it to a Reactive application. You'll see how you can leverage the new Reactive types inside the Spring Framework from the data tier to the web tier.  You will get to see step by step how to convert a traditional Spring MVC application to an end to end reactive application using the WebFlux framework - which is brand new to Spring Framework 5.  Coming Soon to the Course  I plan to add a lot more content to this course!   I want this to be your go-to course for becoming a Spring Framework developer.  Coming soon to the course in 2017:  Building RESTFul APIs with Spring WebFlux (New in Spring Framework 5!) Spring Security Documenting your APIs with RestDoc and Swagger 2 Aspect Oriented Programming Using Spring Events Scheduling Tasks Using JAXB Caching with eHcache Spring JDBC (JDBC Template) Spring RestTemplate JMS Messaging AMQP with RabbitMQ Logging configuration for Logback and Log4J 2 And more real world Spring Framework apps!   Message me if there is a topic you'd like to see!  Spring Framework 5 GA Release  This Spring Framework course is so new, it has been developed using Spring Framework 5 'Release Candidate' releases.

Some additions have been made. ###### I'm new to data science and programming. Some areas of study in this roadmap may be researched to a point of redundancy while materials for other topics could be seriously lacking. As I progress through this learning path, I'll be able to gauge which areas need more (or less) focus and will add and remove resources as needed.  ## Schoolwork ##### Required readings for my Data Science classes. - [ ] [Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline](https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Data-Science-Straight-Frontline/dp/1449358659) by Cathy O'Neil & Rachel Schutt   - [ ] 1.

    "content": "Machine Learning is a wide area of Artificial Intelligence focused in design and development of an algorithm that identifies and learn patterns exist in data provided as input. AI is the catalyst for IR 4.0. This innovation will set an additional or a new approach of governing and managing organizations, particularly companies. It explores the possibility to create intelligent systems that can reason and think like human beings. It is being said to possess similar cognitive abilities as human beings and is now helping the management in making decisions about the allocation and utilization of the resources, solving operation and management problems, as well as advising the strategic development. Billions of people and countless machines will be connected to each other simultaneously and concurrently. Thus, AI will also assist in monitoring and improve those connections and interactions without human intervention to reduce human error and improve the accuracy of decisions made based on strategic analysis of big data captured. It is used as the main driver to obtain competitive advantage and sustainability of companies.  Since the innovation is still new, Malaysian companies might foresee challenges in adopting the innovation into their operations. Sooner or later, companies are forced to accept the new innovation in order to be in parallel with the technological development. An active participation from directors and management in companies can provide a strategic direction and organizational alignment to prevent innovation from failing.  With the introduction of AI and Machine Learning in the TN50, Malaysia has proven that they are ready to move their footstep into more advanced technological development focusing on wider sectors and industries. TN50 is a 30-year plan (2020-2050) that aims to emphasize economic development through advancements in technology, business processes, and innovations, using technology drivers such as robots, machine learning, and AI. With a huge potential benefit and fast evolvement of AI, the primary objectives are to determine the current diffusion stage of AI innovation in Malaysian public listed companies and assess the challenges of AI adoption within the companies.  The idea that computers would one day be able to think like a human had begun the journey of AI and Machine learning over 70 years ago. Early inventions in electronics, engineering, and many other disciplines have influenced the development of AI. The concept of intelligent machines was introduced even before the second half of 20th century and known as \"Ancient History\". Mechanical toys and dolls with the characteristics of mechanic behavior had been created during the time. Scientists define AI as the science of making machines that would require intelligence if done by men. AI and machine learning are concerned with the intelligent category of artifacts.   The concept of machine learning differs according to its level of intensity of intelligence. AI could be stronger or weaker in terms of its intelligence capability. With the adoption of AI innovation, the management and governance of companies will be affected. AI is a new innovation which can help companies to create its value and competitive advantage. The market competition, complexity of production process, product variety, overhead portion, and firm size are factors that can contribute to the adoption of AI innovation. The market competitions, especially the participation of multinational companies in the domestic market of a country, have implication for a local company to design appropriate strategies and control system in the company. The company size sometimes indicates how fast the company adopts the advanced management practice and usually the larger companies the faster they adopt the system. Their arguments are the larger company size lead to an increased complexity of tasks, the companies have greater access to the resource to experiment with administrative innovations.  The innovation in technology and machine has been evolving and become faster with the passage of time. In the wake of AI, regulations related to cybersecurity, emerging technology, and data theft are important to protect the interest of companies as the impact of a breach of data and security is significant and can affect their survival. It will also expose the companies to global challenges which involve societies and humankind. Thus, the legal implication of AI needs to be examined.  Governance on technology and robotics has been established in governing technologies and intelligent machines. This is an example where the legal mechanism is defined in order to mitigate the risk which AI exposes. The development of IR 4.0 exposes to unknown risks in which it is pertinent for the government to examine the impact on the relevant stakeholders in the industry especially the legal risk.  Even though AI can decide or involve in the decision making of companies, the technology is not able to replace the human knowledge and experience in order to provide more valuable decision making to the business. In the long run, the machine needs to be replaced where things change in the future or where it is no longer coping with the complex circumstances. On the other hand, a success of AI system depends on the data volumes and quality of the data input. There may be not sufficient data being provided to support the system. Due to big data supplied to companies nowadays, a huge set of structured and unstructured data need to be filtered and analyzed before they become valuable to the companies.  The ability of computers and system to analyze the data and suggest solutions or strategic changes more quickly than human is beneficial for companies. In addition, the system has the capability to learn, improve and remove a certain degree of potential error or uncertainty from the evolvement of technology. Thus, currently, Malaysian companies are looking at the option of implementing AI system in their management and operations to speed up the decision making process.",

大陆修宪香港恶法台湾武统朝鲜毁约美中冷战等都是王沪宁愚弄习思想极左命运共同体的大策划中共窃国这半个多世纪所犯下的滔天罪恶，前期是毛泽东策划的，中期6.4前后是邓小平策划的，黄牛数据分析后期是毛的极左追随者三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁策划的。王沪宁高小肆业因文革政治和情报需要保送“学院外语班“红色仕途翻身，所以王的本质是极左的。他是在上海底层弄堂长大的，因其本性也促成其瘪三下三滥个性，所以也都说他有易主“变色龙”哈巴狗“的天性。大陆像王沪宁这样学马列政治所谓\"法学\"专业的人，在除朝鲜古巴所有国家特别是在文明发达国家是无法找到专业对口工作必定失业，唯独在大陆却是重用的紧缺“人才”，6.4后中共信仰大危机更是最重用的救党“人才”。这也就是像王沪宁此类工农兵假“大学生”平步青云的原因，他们最熟悉毛泽东历次运动的宫庭内斗经验手段和残酷的阶级斗争等暴力恐怖的“政治学”。王沪宁能平步青云靠他这马毛伪“政治学”资本和头衔，不是什么真才实学，能干实事有点真才实学的或许在他手下的谋士及秘书班子中可以找到。王沪宁的“真才实学”只不过是一个只读四年小学的人，大半辈子在社会上磨炼特别是在中共官场滚打炼出的的手段和经验而已，他和习近平等保送的工农兵假“大学生”都一样，无法从事原“专业”都凭红资本而从政。六四学运期间各界一边倒支持学生，王沪宁一度去法国躲避和筹谋，他还加入了反学运签名，成为极少有的反学运者仕途突显，在六四和苏联垮台后中共意识形态危机，江泽民上台看上唯一能应急的王沪宁聚谋士泡制的\"稳定统一领导\"和之后的\"新权威\"谬论。左转被邓小平南巡阻止后，王策划顺邓经济改革却将政治改革逐步全面终止和倒退，泡制“三个代表”为极左转建立庞大牢固的红色既得利益集团。因此六四后各重大决策和危机难题都摆在中共中央政策研究室王沪宁桌面上，使王沪宁成了此后中共三朝都无法摆脱的幕后最有决策性实权的人，中共中央政策研究室是王为其野心巨资经营几十年，聚众谋士的间谍情报汇总研究的特务机关和策划制定决策重要机构与基地，王沪宁本人和决定其仕途关键的首任岳父及家属就有情报工作背景。中央政研室重要到王沪宁入常后为了死抓这中共情报与决策大权，宁可放弃国家副主席和中央党校校长。后再加个除习外唯他担任的中共几核心领导小组之一的“不忘初心牢记使命”主题教育工作小组组长。此后他把持的舆论必将以宣传“不忘初心牢记使命”为主，打造众所周知的所谓“习思想”其实是”王思想“。王自从主导中央政研室开始决策后，策划中止邓小平的与美妥协路线回归毛极左的反美路线。帮助前南斯拉夫提供情报打落美机放中使馆引发炸使馆事件，以此掀起六四后唯一的全国大规模游行并借此反美而起家。后又帮江泽民提供法轮功会是超过中共组织的情报，策划决策镇压迫害开始并没有把矛头指向江的法轮功群体，策划决定阻止党内外近三十年来平反六四的呼声。致远黑皮书马拉松程序员易支付英语台词文字匹配美团点评各业务线提供知识库团队共享阿里云高精Excel识别德讯

    "content": "Fake News Detection Fake News Detection in Python  In this project, we have used various natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify fake news articles using sci-kit libraries from python.  Getting Started These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.  Prerequisites What things you need to install the software and how to install them:  Python 3.6 This setup requires that your machine has python 3.6 installed on it. you can refer to this url https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download python. Once you have python downloaded and installed, you will need to setup PATH variables (if you want to run python program directly, detail instructions are below in how to run software section). To do that check this: https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/. Setting up PATH variable is optional as you can also run program without it and more instruction are given below on this topic. Second and easier option is to download anaconda and use its anaconda prompt to run the commands. To install anaconda check this url https://www.anaconda.com/download/ You will also need to download and install below 3 packages after you install either python or anaconda from the steps above Sklearn (scikit-learn) numpy scipy if you have chosen to install python 3.6 then run below commands in command prompt/terminal to install these packages pip install -U scikit-learn pip install numpy pip install scipy if you have chosen to install anaconda then run below commands in anaconda prompt to install these packages conda install -c scikit-learn conda install -c anaconda numpy conda install -c anaconda scipy Dataset used The data source used for this project is LIAR dataset which contains 3 files with .tsv format for test, train and validation. Below is some description about the data files used for this project.  LIAR: A BENCHMARK DATASET FOR FAKE NEWS DETECTION  William Yang Wang, \"Liar, Liar Pants on Fire\": A New Benchmark Dataset for Fake News Detection, to appear in Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2017), short paper, Vancouver, BC, Canada, July 30-August 4, ACL.  the original dataset contained 13 variables/columns for train, test and validation sets as follows:  Column 1: the ID of the statement ([ID].json). Column 2: the label. (Label class contains: True, Mostly-true, Half-true, Barely-true, FALSE, Pants-fire) Column 3: the statement. Column 4: the subject(s). Column 5: the speaker. Column 6: the speaker's job title. Column 7: the state info. Column 8: the party affiliation. Column 9-13: the total credit history count, including the current statement. 9: barely true counts. 10: false counts. 11: half true counts. 12: mostly true counts. 13: pants on fire counts. Column 14: the context (venue / location of the speech or statement). To make things simple we have chosen only 2 variables from this original dataset for this classification. The other variables can be added later to add some more complexity and enhance the features.  Below are the columns used to create 3 datasets that have been in used in this project  Column 1: Statement (News headline or text). Column 2: Label (Label class contains: True, False) You will see that newly created dataset has only 2 classes as compared to 6 from original classes. Below is method used for reducing the number of classes.  Original -- New True -- True Mostly-true -- True Half-true -- True Barely-true -- False False -- False Pants-fire -- False The dataset used for this project were in csv format named train.csv, test.csv and valid.csv and can be found in repo. The original datasets are in \"liar\" folder in tsv format.  File descriptions DataPrep.py This file contains all the pre processing functions needed to process all input documents and texts. First we read the train, test and validation data files then performed some pre processing like tokenizing, stemming etc. There are some exploratory data analysis is performed like response variable distribution and data quality checks like null or missing values etc.  FeatureSelection.py In this file we have performed feature extraction and selection methods from sci-kit learn python libraries. For feature selection, we have used methods like simple bag-of-words and n-grams and then term frequency like tf-tdf weighting. we have also used word2vec and POS tagging to extract the features, though POS",

Anyone can share their apps with other users on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} but only organizations that are verified by {% data variables.product.company_short %} can sell apps. For more information about organizations, see \"[About organizations](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-organizations).\"  The verification process aims to protect users. For example, it verifies the seller's identity, checks that their {% data variables.product.product_name %} organization is set up securely, and that they can be contacted for support.   After passing the verification checks, any apps that the organization lists on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} are shown with a verified creator badge {% octicon \"verified\" aria-label=\"Verified creator badge\" %}.

For more information, see \"[Security best practices for apps](/developers/github-marketplace/security-best-practices-for-apps).\"  ### Considerations for free apps  Apps will go through a security review before being listed on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}. A successful review will meet the requirements and follow the security best practices listed in \"[Security review process](/marketplace/getting-started/security-review-process/).\" For information on the review process, contact [marketplace@github.com](mailto:marketplace@github.com). {% data reusables.marketplace.free-apps-encouraged %}   ### Requirements for paid apps  In addition to the requirements for all apps above, each app that you offer as a paid service on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} must also meet the following requirements:  - {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}s should have a minimum of 100 installations. - {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %}s should have a minimum of 200 users. - All paid apps must handle {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} purchase events for new purchases, upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, and free trials.

For information about how integrate these events into your app, see \"[Using the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} API in your app](/developers/github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app).\"  To offer your app as a paid service, you'll need to meet these requirements to list your app on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}: Using GitHub's billing API allows customers to purchase an app without leaving GitHub and to pay for the service with the payment method already attached to their {% data variables.product.product_name %} account.  - To sell your app in {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, it must use GitHub's billing system.

See \"[Differences between GitHub Apps and OAuth Apps](/apps/differences-between-apps/)\" for more details. - Apps should use the principle of least privilege and should only request the OAuth scopes and GitHub App permissions that the app needs to perform its intended functionality. For more information, see [Principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) in Wikipedia. - Apps should provide customers with a way to delete their account, without having to email or call a support person. - Apps should not share tokens between different implementations of the app. For example, a desktop app should have a separate token from a web-based app. Individual tokens allow each app to request the access needed for GitHub resources separately. - Design your app with different user roles, depending on the functionality needed by each type of user. For example, a standard user should not have access to admin functionality, and billing managers might not need push access to repository code. - Apps should not share service accounts such as email or database services to manage your SaaS service. - All services used in your app should have unique login and password credentials. - Admin privilege access to the production hosting infrastructure should only be given to engineers and employees with administrative duties. - Apps should not use personal access tokens to authenticate and should authenticate as an [OAuth App](/apps/about-apps/#about-oauth-apps) or a [GitHub App](/apps/about-apps/#about-github-apps):   - OAuth Apps should authenticate using an [OAuth token](/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/).   - GitHub Apps should authenticate using either a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-a-github-app), [OAuth token](/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps/), or [installation access token](/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-an-installation).  ### Data protection  - Apps should encrypt data transferred over the public internet using HTTPS, with a valid TLS certificate, or SSH for Git. - Apps should store client ID and client secret keys securely. We recommend storing them as [environmental variables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#Getting_and_setting_environment_variables). - Apps should delete all GitHub user data within 30 days of receiving a request from the user, or within 30 days of the end of the user's legal relationship with GitHub. - Apps should not require the user to provide their GitHub password. - Apps should encrypt tokens, client IDs, and client secrets.  ### Logging and monitoring  Apps should have logging and monitoring capabilities. App logs should be retained for at least 30 days and archived for at least one year. A security log should include:  - Authentication and authorization events - Service configuration changes - Object reads and writes - All user and group permission changes - Elevation of role to admin - Consistent timestamping for each event - Source users, IP addresses, and/or hostnames for all logged actions  ### Incident response workflow  To provide a secure experience for users, you should have a clear incident response plan in place before listing your app. We recommend having a security and operations incident response team in your company rather than using a third-party vendor. You should have the capability to notify {% data variables.product.product_name %} within 24 hours of a confirmed incident.  For an example of an incident response workflow, see the \"Data Breach Response Policy\" on the [SANS Institute website](https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy/). A short document with clear steps to take in the event of an incident is more valuable than a lengthy policy template.  ### Vulnerability management and patching workflow  You should conduct regular vulnerability scans of production infrastructure. You should triage the results of vulnerability scans and define a period of time in which you agree to remediate the vulnerability.  If you are not ready to set up a full vulnerability management program, it's useful to start by creating a patching process.

Discussions are for conversations that need to be transparent and accessible but do not need to be tracked on a project board and are not related to code, unlike issues. Discussions enable fluid, open conversation in a public forum.  Discussions give a space for more collaborative conversations by connecting and giving a more centralized area to connect and find information.  ### Enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} on your repository  Repository owners and people with write access can enable {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} for a community on their public repositories.  When you first enable a {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %}, you will be invited to configure a welcome post.  {% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %} 1.

Click **Start discussion**.   ![\"Start discussion\" button](/assets/images/help/discussions/new-discussion-start-discussion-button.png)  ### Welcoming contributions to your discussions  You can welcome your community and introduce a new way to communicate in a repository by creating a welcome post and pin the post to your {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} page. Pinning and locking discussions helps people know that a post is meant as an announcement. You can use announcements as a way to link people to more resources and offer guidance for opening discussions in your community. For more information about pinning a discussion, see \"[Managing discussions in your repository](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions-in-your-repository#pinning-a-discussion).\"   ### Setting up community guidelines for contributors  You can set contributing guidelines to encourage collaborators to have meaningful, useful conversations that are relevant to the repository. You can also update the repository's README to communicate expectations on when collaborators should open an issue or discussion.  For more information about providing guidelines for your project, see \"[Adding a code of conduct to your project](/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project)\" and \"[Setting up your project for healthy contributions](/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions).\"  ### Creating a new discussion  Anyone with access to a repository can create a discussion.  {% data reusables.discussions.starting-a-discussion %}  ### Organizing discussions into relevant categories  Repository owners and people with write access can create new categories to keep discussions organized. Collaborators participating and creating new discussions can group discussions into the most relevant existing categories. Discussions can also be recategorized after they are created. For more information, see \"[Managing categories for discussions in your repository](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-categories-for-discussions-in-your-repository)\"  ### Promoting healthy conversations  People with write permissions for a repository can help surface important conversations by pinning discussions, deleting discussions that are no longer useful or are damaging to the community, and transferring discussions to more relevant repositories owned by the organization. For more information, see \"[Managing discussions in your repository](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions-in-your-repository).\"  People with triage permissions for a repository can help moderate a project's discussions by marking comments as answers, locking discussions that are not longer useful or are damaging to the community, and converting issues to discussions when an idea is still in the early stages of development. For more information, see \"[Moderating discussions](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/moderating-discussions).\"  ### Next steps  Once there is a clear path to scope work out and move an idea from concept to reality, you can create an issue and start tracking your progress.

Each organization can have multiple classrooms.  After you create a classroom, {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} will prompt you to invite teaching assistants (TAs) and admins to the classroom. Each classroom can have one or more admins. Admins can be teachers, TAs, or any other course administrator who you'd like to have control over your classrooms on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}.  Invite TAs and admins to your classroom by inviting the user accounts on {% data variables.product.product_name %} to your organization as organization owners and sharing the URL for your classrom. Organization owners can administer any classroom for the organization. For more information, see \"[Permission levels for an organization](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/permission-levels-for-an-organization)\" and \"[Inviting users to join your organization](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/inviting-users-to-join-your-organization).\"  When you're done using a classroom, you can archive the classroom and refer to the classroom, roster, and assignments later, or you can delete the classroom if you no longer need the classroom.  ### About classroom rosters  Each classroom has a roster. A roster is a list of identifiers for the students who participate in your course.  When you first share the URL for an assignment with a student, the student must sign into {% data variables.product.product_name %} with a user account to link the user account to an identifier for the classroom. After the student links a user account, you can see the associated user account in the roster. You can also see when the student accepts or submits an assignment.  ![Classroom roster](/assets/images/help/classroom/roster-hero.png)  ### Prerequisites  You must have an organization account on {% data variables.product.product_name %} to manage classrooms on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}.

Some additions have been made. ###### I'm new to data science and programming. Some areas of study in this roadmap may be researched to a point of redundancy while materials for other topics could be seriously lacking.
